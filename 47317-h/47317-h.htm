OF SAMUEL J. TILDEN</span></p>


<h2>DAVID A. WELLS TO TILDEN</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Norwich, Conn</span>, <i>Jan'y 6th, 1876</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Governor</span>,&mdash;I do not know as I can testify
of my admiration of your message better than by saying
that I want you to send me an early copy in pamphlet form
for more careful reading and preservation.</p>

<p>"When the novel which Mr. Sherman and I have been
writing (now in press) comes out, in a week or two, please
see how curiously prices worked on our imaginary island,
where the people used something for currency which had no
value as a commodity.</p>

<p class="sig">
"Very truly yours,<br />
"<span class="smcap">David A. Wells</span>."
</p>

<p>Answered January 10, 1876, by the Governor, that he desired
to submit some of the messages to Mr. Wells, but it
was a race against time. The tables were not completed
until the discussion was in the proof-reading. "Even I was
surprised at the surplus of currency which they evince."</p>


<h2>CHARLES O'CONOR TO TILDEN</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Fort Washington</span>, <i>Jan'y 12, 1876</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Governor Tilden</span>,&mdash;In this form I will say
nothing of the proceedings, surprising to me, as they must
have been to you, which have marked the movements toward
trying the Tweed civil cases. I have neither seen nor heard
from the present chief of the 'bureau of municipal correction'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
since the newspapers began to regale us with its recent
fortunes.</p>

<p>"My object in addressing you is to submit certain suggestions
for consideration.</p>

<p>"When the present leading counsel for Tweed fell into a
line of practice which, steadily pursued for years as it has
been, might well have led to his being dubbed Attorney-General
for Rascals, it was my lot to be much in professional
antagonism to him. I found him to be neither wise,
learned, nor, properly speaking, able, but essentially a
trickster. He seems capable of being very troublesome, and
to a <em>negligent</em> or unskilful adversary he may be regarded as
dangerous.</p>

<p>"In dealing with his class, one will generally find a central
device around which all their series of tricks revolve,
and from which all their force and effectiveness are drawn.
This man's course and career furnish an admirable illustration
of this fact.</p>

<p>"Our multitude of judges, with equal powers, were perceived
by him to furnish a hopeful quarry. One wicked,
weak, or manageable could be found somewhere. The next
item in his scheme for making judicial proceedings do the
work which a bolder thief might seek to accomplish by
piracy, highway robbery, or counterfeiting was to engage
himself in quarrels where an unlimited number of separate
suits by separate plaintiffs might be brought before different
judges&mdash;all aimed at the same substantial object. This enabled
him to make almost at random all sorts of harassing
movements against the same parties. Slap-dash, hit or miss,
he poured his shot upon the selected victims, the loss of a
suit or failure of a movement troubling him not, the number
of strings to his bow making this of no more consequence
to him than the loss of a single soldier to the general
of an army.</p>

<p>"You are aware that any single stockholder in a private
or trading corporation may file a bill in equity against the
corporation itself, its managing officers, and any one else
suggesting malversation, and, of course, such a suit has all
the usual incidents of receivership, injunctions, etc., etc.
With a desperate Wall Street swindler for plaintiff, an utterly
unscrupulous legal practitioner to direct it, and an
unprincipled or manageable judge, the blackmailing capabilities
of such a suit are not slight. And when you consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
that the stock is always in the market, and that five
shares, or, indeed, a single share, may be sufficient to qualify
a plaintiff, you see the readiness with which a lot of
these suits, like a swarm of insects in summer, may harass.
It was with this single scrap of technical knowledge that
the Attorney-General for Scoundrels qualified himself for his
office. In a very large degree he has lived upon it ever since.</p>

<p>"It was in analogy to this right of the stockholder of a
private corporation that some well-intentioned persons devised
the scheme of judicially restraining municipal and
other public officers from improper action. I believe the
history of the rise and fall of this idea may be found in a
long argument of mine reported in 'Wetmore <i>v.</i> Story,' <i>22</i>
or <i>23 Barbour</i>. You have read it and spoken of it to me.
There is no analogy between the cases, and no basis in our
common-law or customary jurisprudence for the pretended
right of a taxpayer thus to intervene. The inconveniences
of such a practice would be enormous. It should not be permitted.</p>

<p>"Using a noted and life-long corruptionist, Charles
Devlin, one of Tweed's bail, the Scoundrel's Attorney-General
has brought a suit of this kind intended to perplex the Ring
prosecutions and aid in misleading the thoughtless readers
of their partisan journals.</p>

<p>"I have said that such a suit is wholly without warrant
in the common law, and the claim to sustain it thereby has
been by the highest authority, in every form, judicially exploded;
but in two statutes it may find some color at least
of support, and I write in the hope that these may be at
once repealed.</p>

<p>"The first of these is S. 3 of the city tax levy of 1864,
ch. 405, p. 945. It was obtained by Nathaniel Sands, the
then leader of reform, as actuary or general agent of Peter
Cooper's Citizens' Association. His subsequent history is
known to you. The other is ch. 161 of the laws of 1872,
p. 467. You were then in the Legislature, and may have
favored its passage; it is not impossible that I may have
failed to condemn it when spoken to, but I never believed
in the utility of such a remedy. A reluctance to throw cold
water on the efforts of our friends sometimes dictates a
prudent silence. But whatever might be said at that time,
the law of 1875, establishing the right of the State, has
superseded the use of any such private taxpayer's action,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
and this inexpressibly impudent suit of Devlin shows that
the privilege tends to mischief. I hope you will get some
real and earnest reformer belonging to the Republican party
to bring in and push through a bill for the repeal of both
these enactments.</p>

<p>"Another subject may seem to demand attention, and
that speedily. In Polly Bodine's case, some years ago, it
was found that the public journals had so thoroughly imbued
the minds of the people with information or reports
and ideas concerning the facts of the case that under the
existing common law touching challenges to the favor it was
hardly possible to get a jury. This must be so in Tweed's
cases. The Legislature then altered the law, but I am told
that the change is confined in its terms to criminal cases.
It ought, by supplemental legislation, to be extended to all
cases.</p>

<p class="sig">
Yours faithfully,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Ch. O'Conor</span>."

<h2>BONAMY PRICE TO TILDEN</h2>

<p class="sig">"<span class="smcap">2 Norham Gardens, Oxford</span>, <i>Jan'y 31, 1876</i>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I hope that the great kindness which
you showed me at New York will be allowed to plead my
excuse with you for trespassing on your time with a few
lines.</p>

<p>"I am anxious to tell you of the deep sympathy and interest
with which I have closely watched your public career
since I had the honor of becoming acquainted with you in
America, as well as the strong admiration which it excited
in me.</p>

<p>"Never did a man deserve better of his country; and I
fervently hope that the new year will bring the amplest
recognition of this fact from your fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p class="sig">
"Yours truly,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Bonamy Price</span>."
</p>


<h2>THOMAS COTTMAN TO TILDEN</h2>

<p class="sig">"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <i>Feb'y 6th, 1876</i>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I see by the papers this morning that
Senator Francis Kernan had taken steps to reconcile the discordant
elements of the Democratic party of this city. I
am convinced of the unpracticability of the effort without
your active interposition. Success with Tammany as at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
present organized is entirely out of the question. John
Kelly, as chief, with Ned Gale, Tom Boize, Frank Spinola,
Billy Boyd, and the like as chief counsel, will inevitably
bring disaster upon the party and turn the State over to
the Republicans in the fall. I would in no wise depreciate
Mr. Kelly, whom I regard as a very estimable gentleman.
But he has been most unfortunate in selecting his '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entourage</i>.'
There is no lack of efficient material in this city for
constructing a capital to the Democratic edifice and insure
harmony in all its proportions. As at present constituted,
it is an incongruous mass, ready to disintegrate and form
other affinities. Without some decided action on your part,
there will most certainly be two delegations from this city
to the convention, and the bad blood thus generated will outcrop
in the fall election to the detriment of the party. I
shall leave home to-morrow night for Washington, where I
expect to remain a short time to confer with my Democratic
friends from the different sections of the country. There
being quite a number of my acquaintances representing different
constituencies in Congress, the dissensions of the
New York Democracy are certain to form the leading topic
of conversation and the topic upon which the least satisfaction
can be vouchsafed&mdash;and the entire responsibility laid at
your door. Your personal friendship for Andrew H. Green
might have been so evinced as not to have provoked antagonism
to yourself, and might have availed by its influence
to have kept him from exciting the wrath of a majority of
the voting community. Wickham is weaker than Green in
the popular estimation. Wickham is looked upon as milk
and water, whilst Green is regarded as gall and wormwood,
whilst Kelly is so encumbered with <em>barnacles</em> as to be impervious
to the popular demand for a more democratic form
of government than that now run exclusively for the benefit
of favorites.</p>

<p class="sig">
Very respectfully yours,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Thomas Cottman</span>."
</p>


<h2>A. E. SILLIMAN TO TILDEN</h2>

<p>"Please do not trouble yourself to read until at entire
leisure.</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">56 Clinton St., Brooklyn,</span> <i>Feb. 14, '76</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am indebted to some kind friend for
a copy of your Message for 1876 (secluded among my books,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
I do not know whom); but recollecting your conversations
with Mr. Bennett and myself some years since at Delmonico's,
I am fain to believe that I am one of a number to
whom you may have directed it to be sent; but in the uncertainty
deem it more decorous to address you <em>personally</em>
in my recognition of the favor. I read the Message at the
time of its appearance with much interest, and was particularly
struck with the strong clearness and distinctness of
that portion of it pertaining to financial affairs, which perhaps
is the 'part of the schooner' I am (or rather ought to
be) more particularly conversant with. We are much indebted
to Mr. Chase for the present state of things&mdash;his
refusal to recognize the banks as government depositors,
and have a clearing-house for the daily settlement of its
debt, with <em>enormous</em> resulting economy of its <em>physical</em> features
(for instance, the issue of legal-tender notes under
such circumstances need not have exceeded one hundred
million)&mdash;but mainly for setting loose under his national
bank system a thousand <em>new</em> inflating-machines, called banks,
practically unmuzzling the old banks which he cowed in
under its flag. Admitting other causes, in my opinion it
is mainly<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the bank inflation which has caused the state of
things <em>culminating</em> in 1873; and which crisis, opening the
eyes of the community to its truths on the one side, shows
them the terrors of contraction on the other, and the natural
apprehension of a sudden contraction to a specie basis produces
thus, of course, almost paralysis in all business movement
beyond the <em>immediate</em> present. I do not think that
the plan for <em>arbitrary</em> resumption in 1879 will be attended
with happy effect. 'There is no royal road to learning,'
and assuredly none to specie resumption. We have slid
down the hill with intense velocity; we have got <em>slowly</em> to
trudge up the hill again through the snow if we would have
another slide. I think that if ten years ago we had commenced
destroying the legal tender at the rate of 5 per cent.
per annum we would have avoided <i>1873</i>, and have been paying
specie now; and I think if we commence<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> now in that
ratio we shall in ten years arrive at the desired result, relieving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
the business community from the bugbear of rapid contraction.
The destruction of <i>20</i> million legal-tender would
carry with it <i>80</i> million bank credit&mdash;say, an annual contraction
of <i>100</i> million. This, if the country is let alone,
with a decent attention to the economy you suggest, it could
have from the increasing receipts of its industry. In <i>1873</i>,
as a matter of <em>curiosity</em>, I examined into the statistics of
finance for the periods stated, and it is from them I draw
my conclusions above expressed. I annex a copy, as perhaps
your experienced eye will take in at a glance the
gravity of the record. Now, my dear sir, I hope you will
excuse my troubling you with this long note, and not trouble
yourself to answer it. With hopes that you may be blessed
in health, and remain long as the head of your State, I am</p>

<h2>CHARLES O'CONOR TO TILDEN</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Fort Washington</span>, <i>March 16th, 1876</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Governor</span>,&mdash;I had the honor of addressing
you some time ago concerning the expediency of repealing
a section of 1864 and an act of 1867, both of which most
absurdly recognized a right of action in tax-payers for maladministration
by public corporations.</p>

<p>"My reason for urging the step at this time is an action by
one Charles Devlin, Tweed's bail, against the Attorney-General
and others, seeking the appointment of a receiver and the
transfer of the Ring suits to the control of the Tweed faction.
Tweed's attorneys are attorneys for the plaintiff in
this action, and for their motions they select as judge
Charles Donohue, who, by the order for a bill of particulars,
showed his fidelity to Tweed principles.</p>

<p>"It is ridiculous that such a suit should be permitted to
harass us and bring our movements under the control of
Donohue.</p>

<p>"I have supposed that a real reformer of the Republican
party should be enlisted to push this repeal through, and if
you select such an one I am willing, if put in communication
with him, to aid him in any way that I can, and, if need
be, I will go to Albany to co-operate with him.</p>

<p>"The relations of D. D. Field and Judge Peabody are
such that the latter, though a very correct and honorable
man, ought not to be drawn into this affair. Of course, his
son, the member of Assembly, is subject to the same remark.
And as young Mr. Fish and he are <em>very</em> intimate, and reside
together in private joint lodgings, I would advise that Mr.
Fish be not included in any movement on this subject.</p>

<h2>WHEELER H. PECKHAM TO S. J. TILDEN</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <i>April 15th, 1876</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I enclose draft of a bill appropriating
twenty-five thousand dollars for expenses prosecuting the
ring suits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span></p>

<p>"The last appropriation was in 1874, ch. 359, laws of
that year&mdash;$25,000.</p>

<p>"Of the sum then appropriated but about $8000 are left.
The expenses of the last civil trial of Tweed will more than
exhaust this. The disbursements of that trial are about
$3000, and Mr. Carter's very moderate bill is $5000. That
exhausts the appropriation without any bill for my own
services.</p>

<p>"The trial was protracted and expensive beyond expectation.
It consumed the two months of January and February
and part of March. The deft. Tweed is making a
case and will appeal, and consequently further expense must
be incurred. The case vs. Sweeney is also ready for trial,
and we expect to try it in May. Active proceedings are
pending against others, which must result in the collection
of very considerable sums of money. Over half a million
of dollars has already been realized and paid over to the
city treasury. Under the circumstances, it seems to me that
there should be no hesitation on the part of the Legislature
in passing the bill.</p>

<p>"Of course, the force of my opinion must be weighed
in the light of my own interest. On that account it is proper
to add that I have submitted this proposed law to your consideration
at the request of Mr. O'Conor.</p>

<p class="sig">
"Yours truly,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Wheeler H. Peckham</span>."<br />

request.&mdash;W. H. P."</p>

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Governor</span>,&mdash;I have canvassed the political
situation in this State since I last saw you, and think there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
is no doubt of your receiving the unanimous support of
Connecticut at St. Louis. Indeed, there is no diversity of
sentiment, so far as I can hear, Loomis, of New London,
being the only one of the delegates whom I should regard as
doubtful. Dick Hubbard, of Hartford, who heads the delegation;
Waller, of New London, the Speaker of the House
(who will probably go as a substitute); and Hunter, of Willimantic,
are all to be relied on as warm supporters, and
they will control the delegation if it should need controlling.
Barr, of Hartford, is a tricky fellow, and if you could
bring some influence to bear on him it may be as well,
though I am advised that it is not necessary.</p>

<p>"There is one element of the future that I do not like,
and that is the probable election of Barnum to the Senate
from this State in place of English. Barnum is so unfit,
so much of the Tweed order of men, and a pig-iron protectionist
into the bargain, that the effect of his election will
be bad, not only in the State, but throughout the country.
It will be cited everywhere as a proof that the professions
of the party do not amount to anything; I do not, however,
know what you can do about it, or whether it would be advisable
to exert an influence if you could; but it is an event
that is likely to disgust the free-trade element intensely,
and also those who have a deep conviction of the necessity
of political reform. Eaton is probably more responsible
for this movement than any other man, except Barnum.</p>

<p>"Do you think I had better go to the 18th of May conference?
I see nothing antagonistic in it to your interest;
neither do I think it will amount to much. I know the
Republican managers have a most profound contempt for
the whole movement, and haven't an idea of allowing to
Bristow to be nominated.</p>

<p>"<i>Hon. S. J. Tilden.</i>"
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Shortly after the inauguration of Mr. Tilden as Governor,
in January, 1875, he sent to the Legislature a special
message setting forth his convictions of the corrupt management
of the canals of the State. This message abounded
with specific details of fraud of so infamous a character that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
even friends of the implicated contractors in the Legislature
felt constrained to grant the request of the Governor, and
by a concurrent resolution, adopted on the 31st day of
March, 1875, authorized him to appoint a committee of
four "to investigate the affairs of the canals of the State,
and especially the matters embraced in the special message
of the Governor, communicated to Legislature on the 19th
of March, 1875."</p>

<p>In compliance with this authority, the Governor appointed
four gentlemen, whose names are signed to the
following report, two theretofore having acted with the
Republican party and two with the Democratic. The
Governor's commissioners organized at Albany on the 12th
of April following; but before they began to take testimony
the friends of the canal jobbers in the Assembly managed
to pass a resolution appointing a commission of that body
also to make a similar investigation, but naming in the resolution
commissioners satisfactory to those who constituted
what was known as the "Canal Ring."</p>

<p>This commission met two or three times, and then
offered to the Governor's commission, under pretext of saving
time and expense, to join them, so that the two commissions
should constitute but one body. Of course this proffer
was promptly declined, and the legislative commission took
no more testimony, and was never heard of again.</p>

<p>The interval between the organization of the Governor's
commission, in April, and the time for the introduction of
water into the canals, near the end of May, was devoted
exclusively to an examination of the most important works
in progress or recently completed in the prism of the canals.</p>

<p>Between the 31st day of July of that year, when the commission
submitted its first report, and the 14th of February,
when it submitted its final report, it issued twelve reports.
That which follows gives a summary of the facts developed
by the investigation which confirm in every detail the
charges made in the Governor's message, besides adding very
much to the total amount of confirming testimony. The
reason for this confirmation being so complete was that the
Governor, almost immediately after his election, employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
privately, and at his own expense, an engineer in whose
professional training and experience he could place entire
confidence, the late Mr. Elkanah Sweet, to make an investigation
of the recent canal work, gave him authority to take
down any portion of the work to ascertain how far and in
what way it was not in conformity with the contract, and
gave him also authority to inspect all the canal contracts in
the archives of the Canal Board and compare them with his
observations. Upon his report the facts presented in the
Governor's canal message were based. Mr. Sweet, therefore,
was naturally employed by the Governor's commission to
make the yet more thorough and elaborate investigation required
of them.</p>

<p>The Governor's canal message, with this incontestable
confirmation of all its allegations, gave him a national fame,
and contributed more than anything he had previously done
to make his nomination to the Presidency a political necessity
for the Democratic party.</p>

<p>Several previous efforts to investigate frauds in the operation
of the State canals had been made by the Legislature,
but all had theretofore proved abortive. One reason which
contributed largely to prevent the investigation of the Governor's
commission sharing the same fate was the exclusion
of reporters from the meetings of the board during the examination
of witnesses. By this means nothing of its work
was given to the public until the testimony was digested
into an intelligible report of what had been proved. The
testimony was necessarily so largely technical that if given
to the press day by day, as received, the public would have
soon tired of the subject, and, what was worse, the witnesses
would have been tempted to shape their testimony rather to
its effects upon the newspaper public than upon the commissioners.
The consequence was that when the reports appeared
they were read, and their impact upon the public
was proportionately prompt, instructive, and penetrating.</p>

<h2><i>CANAL INVESTIGATING COMMISSION</i></h2>

<h3>FIRST REPORT TO THE GOVERNOR<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></h3>

<p class="hanging">
"<i>To his Excellency the Governor, and to the Honorable
the Legislature of the State of New York</i>:
</p>

<p>"The undersigned commissioners, appointed by the Governor,
with the advice and consent of the Senate, under a
concurrent resolution of the Legislature adopted on the 31st
day of March last, 'to investigate the affairs of the canals
of the States, and especially the matters embraced in the
special message of the Governor, communicated to the Legislature
on the 19th day of March, 1875,' have the honor to
submit the following report of the progress of their investigations:</p>

<p>"Your commissioners, assembled at the capitol, qualified
and organized on the 12th day of April, 1875. The interval
between that time and the opening of the canals, a period of
about six weeks, was devoted exclusively to an examination
of the most important works in progress, or recently completed
in the prism of the canals. When this examination
was interrupted by the introduction of water, near the end
of May, your commission returned to the capitol and proceeded
to supplement and enlarge the area of their information
by the examination of witnesses.</p>

<p>"In this work they were unexpectedly embarrassed by
a decision of one of the judges of this district, at Special
Term, denying to them a power, which they supposed to
have been conferred upon them by the legislative authorities,
to require the production before them of the books and
papers of witnesses. They directed an appeal to be taken
from this decision, and it was finally reversed at the General
Term, but not until late in the month of November, till
when your commission was obliged to contend with all the
inconveniences resulting from the privation of such a necessary
and indispensable prerogative. The opinion of Justice
Learned at the Special Term, and that of Justice James
at the General Term, are annexed to this report.</p>

<p>"On the 31st of July the commission submitted their
first annual report to the Governor. It relates to a contract<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
for substituting slope and vertical for bench wall between
Port Schuyler and the lower Mohawk aqueduct. This report
was followed at intervals by eleven others, entitled,
respectively, as follows:</p>

<p>"Second report.&mdash;H. D. Denison's contract east of the
city of Utica.</p>

<p>"Third report.&mdash;Hulser's bridge contract.</p>

<p>"Fourth report.&mdash;Willard Johnson's lower side cut lock
contract at West Troy.</p>

<p>"Fifth report.&mdash;Buffalo contracts and legislative awards.</p>

<p>"Sixth report.&mdash;Champlain enlargement; Bullard's bend
contract.</p>

<p>"Seventh report.&mdash;Buffalo contracts and State officers.</p>

<p>"Eighth report.&mdash;The Baxter award.</p>

<p>"Ninth report.&mdash;Contract of E. W. Williams for building
vertical wall at Rome.</p>

<p>"Tenth report.&mdash;Flagler &amp; Reilley's pending contract at
Fort Plain.</p>

<p>"Eleventh report.&mdash;Jordan level contracts.</p>

<p>"Twelfth report.&mdash;The auditor's traffic in canal certificates.</p>

<p>"A copy of these several reports, together with the testimony
taken before the commission, covering together 2927
pages, are submitted with this report.</p>

<p>"Several other reports are in course of preparation. One
on the Glen's Fall feeder, a second on the Canal Appraiser's
ice awards at Rochester in 187 , and a third on the W. C.
Stevens contract assigned to Denison, Belden &amp; Co., for
dredging the Albany basin, dated December 31, 1866, will
be submitted at an early day.</p>

<p>"Though we have given this investigation our most unremitting
and exclusive attention, we not only have not
exhausted the subject, but there are many matters falling
within the range of our inquiry which we have only been
able to touch incidentally. Among these we regret that the
subjects of 'ordinary repairs,' the lateral canals, and the
present system of appraising canal damages are included.</p>

<p>"As we have been able to examine only a limited portion
of the work done on the canals since 1868, of course we have
found it impossible to extend our inquiries beyond that year,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
though we have abundant evidence that the mismanagement
of the canals dates from a much earlier period. But the results
of our investigation&mdash;incomplete as any investigation
made in so short a time must necessarily have been&mdash;will,
we think, suffice to indicate with tolerable distinctness what
have been the more mischievous errors in the management
of our canals, and some of their more obvious correctives.</p>

<p>"We propose to-day to submit to you such of the conclusions
as we have reached, with all the testimony we have
taken, reserving for a later day some further recommendations
which are under consideration.</p>

<p>"Introductory to such conclusions as we are now prepared
to submit to you, it is proper that we first invite your
attention to the character of our canal property as an investment,
and show precisely how it stands upon the books
of the State.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"If to this be added the interest on the canal debt, the
cost of collection, and the difference between miscellaneous
expenses and receipts, as set forth in detail in Exhibit B,
the loss to the State from the canals during the last fiscal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
year will be found to amount to the enormous sum of
$1,412,470.79.</p>

<p>"The cost of repairs and maintenance is so obviously out
of all proportion with the necessities of a system of completed
structures like our canals, which have little that is
complicated or perishable about them, that we are forced to
seek the explanation of it in their administration.</p>

<p>"Our investigation was not long in revealing the fact
that the canals have not been managed upon the principles
which would govern any man in the administration of his
private estate. The interests of the public have been systematically
disregarded. The precautions with which the
Legislature has attempted to defend this property from
peculation and fraud, and secure for it faithful and efficient
service, have been deliberately and persistently disregarded;
while the responsibility of its agents has been so divided
and distributed as to leave the State comparatively remediless
and at the mercy of the predatory classes, who have
been, if they do not continue to be, a formidable political
power.</p>

<p>"The more conspicuous evidences of mismanagement
which our investigation has disclosed may be divided into
three categories:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<i>First</i>, as to the modes of letting contracts.</p>

<p>"<i>Second</i>, as to the modes of measuring and estimating
work to the contractors.</p>

<p>"<i>Third</i>, as to the facilities for procuring legislative relief.</p></blockquote>

<p>"<i>First</i>, as to the mode of letting the contracts:</p>

<p>"It seems to have been the practice for years to let contracts
upon conditions which exclude honest contractors and
confine this business, at least as to what are termed 'extraordinary
repairs,' almost exclusively to large capitalists.
The large deposits required from contractors discouraged
bidders with small means, while the encouragement offered
to unbalanced bidding, by a neglect to enforce the faithful
performance of the provisions of the contract, have a tendency
to exclude all who bid fair prices, with the honest
intention of giving the State fair work for them. Till
since the commencement of this investigation we do not
know of a single instance in which any forfeiture of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
deposit had been enforced against any contractor; while
we believe we do no one any injustice in saying that no contract
has been let since 1868 the provisions of which have
been properly complied with.</p>

<p>"There has been a corresponding disregard of all the
provisions of law regulating the letting of the contracts.
The law wisely required a preliminary survey, with maps,
specifications, and estimates to be made by the division engineer,
approved by the State Engineer and by the Canal
Board, before a contract could be let. The purpose of these
precautions was to ascertain the amount and probable cost
of the work as a means of determining the relative merits
of the respective bids, and to serve as a protection against
false or erroneous estimates of engineers. These precautions
have been almost universally neglected. The result
has been that the amount of work and materials required
in the actual construction varied so widely from the quantities
let that in nearly every instance the person receiving
the contract proved in the end to have been the highest
instead of the lowest bidder;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and we cannot resist the conclusion
that these precautions in many instances were
neglected with the intent to afford greater facilities for defrauding
the State. These evils have been greatly aggravated
by the frequent changes of the engineers on the canals
and the loss of knowledge as to work done, which the removed
engineers carried away with them.</p>

<p>"<i>Second</i>, as to the mode of measuring and estimating
work to the contractors:</p>

<p>"This responsible duty, involving, as it should, a perfect
familiarity with the terms of the contract and with the
character of the work in progress, has been devolved, not
by law, but in practice, entirely upon assistants who are not
sworn; who, but in few instances, have been found to possess
a competent knowledge of engineering; and who, in
most cases, appear to owe their positions, and therefore to
have been in a greater or less degree dependent upon the
political favor and influence of the contracting class. It
will be hardly a matter of surprise, therefore, that in not
more than a single instance that has come under our scrutiny
have we found the work faithfully measured, or a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
contract closed, under which the contractor has not received
more than he was entitled to.</p>

<p>"Under these influences, operating in favor of the contractor
and to the prejudice of the State, a system of fraudulent
estimates and measurements has become so established
that though in direct and flagrant violation of the very language
of the contract, it is deliberately defended by those
who profit by it, on the ground that it has been sanctioned
by long usage. For example: it has been a practice of the
engineers to allow the contractor for excavating behind vertical
wall, on a slope of one to one, without regard to the
necessity for such excavation, and whether the excavation
was made or not.</p>

<p>"As nearly all vertical wall is constructed in the winter
or early spring, and when the banks are frozen, the cut is
usually vertical or nearly so, and any charge for such excavation
is a fraud upon the State. The contracts also uniformly
provide that the contractor shall be allowed nothing
for the filling in of the place supposed to be excavated behind
the walls, if such filling is from earth already paid
for as excavation, unless he is obliged to draw his material
more than 200 feet on the line of the canal. This provision
has also come to be treated as obsolete, and the State seems
to have been uniformly charged not only for excavation
which had not been made, but for filling up the assumed
excavation which, had it been made, the State was not bound
to pay for. The profits derived in this indirect way through
the fraudulent connivance of the agents of the State, has led
to an enormous expenditure for works wholly unnecessary,
and which to keep in repair must continue to subject the
State to a very considerable yearly expense.</p>

<p>"One of the principal expenditures upon the canals since
1868 for extraordinary repairs has been made in the construction
of vertical and slope walls which have been, as
we think, very unwisely substituted for the old walls, the
capacity of the canals before their removal having been
ample for all their business.</p>

<p>"Between the 1st of January, 1868, and the 1st of July,
1875, there have been built forty-three and one-third miles,
linear measure, of vertical wall, at a total cost, including
the removal of bench walls which they displaced, of $1,589,885,
the cost per linear foot averaging $6.95.</p>

<p>"These walls, besides costing four or five times as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
as the slope walls, are less durable, much more expensive to
keep in repair, and possess no substantial advantage except
in large towns, the commerce of which requires special facilities
for docking. But of the forty-three and one-third
miles built since 1868, it cannot be pretended that so many
as three were needed to meet such exigencies.</p>

<p>"Without stopping at present to inquire if the business
of the canal justified the removal of the old bench walls at
all, it is very certain that a good slope wall would have been
preferable throughout nine-tenths, at least, of the entire
extent upon which vertical wall has been constructed; and,
at the rate paid for slope wall during this period, would
have resulted in an economy to the State of not less than
$1,300,000, or nearly $200,000 a year.</p>

<p>"An important item in the cost of this vertical wall was
made up of the fictitious estimates to which we have already
alluded. Assuming that the State was uniformly charged
with fictitious excavation and embankment along the entire
length of this vertical wall&mdash;and we have no satisfactory
proof that a single rod of it was entitled to be excepted&mdash;the
loss to the State from this source alone cannot be estimated
at less than $230,000.</p>

<p>"We have found all the other more important provisions
of these contracts as uniformly disregarded. We have torn
down and carefully examined the work under more than
forty contracts; and we cannot name one in which the work
comes up, even approximately, to the specifications. The
contracts define with great precision the size and character
of the stone to be used, the mode of their disposition, the
thickness and other dimensions of the wall, the character
of the cement and sand, the quality of lining, and what else
is needed to insure durability and a capacity to resist the
shocks from loaded boats to which the walls of canals are
constantly subjected. In no one of the forty-odd contracts
that we examined did we find the stone either in size or
disposition; the dimensions of the wall; the quality of the
sand, lime, cement, and gravel, to correspond with the specifications.
The consequences to the State are not only that
it has been called upon to pay for a higher class of work
than it has received, but that it is exposed to a large annual
expenditure to keep these ill-constructed and for the most
part worthless walls in repair. It has been a not uncommon
circumstance for the superintendent to be called upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
to repair the earlier work under a vertical wall contract
while other portions of the structure were still in progress.
To keep this class of walls in repair promises to be one of
the principal sources of expense for the future maintenance
of our canals.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>"Nor is this system of fictitious estimates confined to
vertical wall. Since 1868 fifty-three and two-thirds miles
of slope wall have been built. By the terms of the contracts
these walls should have had an average thickness of at least
fifteen inches, measured perpendicularly to the slope. None
of the stone composing it should have been less than twelve
inches in length at right angles to the face, and the rear of
the wall was to rest on a base of clean, hard gravel nine
inches thick. The engineers have uniformly estimated these
walls at the specified thickness of fifteen inches, while in
point of fact we have not found on any of our canals a
single stretch of slope wall, constructed since 1868, that
would average over ten inches. Of course, the stones are
usually smaller than the minimum size required by the
specifications, and we did not find a single specimen of the
clean, hard gravel lining required by the contract; so that
the State has been made to pay, throughout the whole forty-three
and two-thirds miles of slope wall, for one-third more
of constructed wall than it has received&mdash;full prices for a
very inferior quality of stone&mdash;and for lining the whole
work, though not a single yard of the required quality appears
to have been ever furnished.</p>

<p>"To confirm our own judgments, and to be sure that we
were not applying an erroneous standard to the work done
in the prism of the canals, we invited Professors Peter S.
Michie and J. B. Wheeler, of the United States Military
Academy at West Point, to go over a large proportion of
what we had already visited and to give us the benefit of
their judgment about it. Their report is annexed, and
will be found to accord in all substantial particulars with
the opinions we have felt it our duty to express in our previous
report to his Excellency the Governor, and in this
communication, in reference to all the contract work on the
canals that has fallen under our observation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Third</i>, as to the facilities afforded by the Legislature
to contractors for procuring legislative relief:</p>

<p>"These facilities appear to have been grossly and corruptly
abused under the discretionary power conferred upon
the Canal Board by the Legislature. Numbers of contracts
have been cancelled when such portions of the work as were
let on terms profitable to the contractor had been executed,
while those portions of the work that were let upon terms
more advantageous to the State were left unexecuted. In
such cases it not unfrequently happened that this remaining
work was let to the same parties, under a new contract,
at much higher rates. When the Canal Board was found to
turn a deaf ear to such appeals, these applications for relief
would be addressed directly to the Legislature, where the
fear of doing injustice, and the want of the time and familiarity
with the subject necessary for investigating its details,
often permitted the allowance of awards conceived in fraud
and without a single legal or equitable merit.</p>

<p>"An illustration of this class of abuses will be found in
the fifth and seventh reports of this commission to the Governor.
For one of them&mdash;the case of the award for the
relief of John Hand&mdash;George D. Lord, a member of the
Assembly which made the award, is now under indictment,
it appearing that the claim made in his behalf was altogether
fraudulent and the alleged proofs fictitious. Another award
was also made to George D. Lord of $119,000 for alleged
losses under contracts with the State for work in Buffalo
harbor. This was, to all appearances, as much greater an
abuse of legislative credulity, as the amount exceeded that
which was realized under the award to John Hand. The
limited technical knowledge of canal administration possessed
by a large majority of State legislators, and the
claims of other important business upon their attention,
make it impossible for them to properly scrutinize appeals
of this character, which are usually pressed by designing
men, perfectly familiar with all the resources for deception
which our complicated canal system afforded, prior to the
constitutional amendment of 1874.</p>

<p>"In view of the systematic infidelity of the agents of
the State which this investigation has disclosed, is it surprising
that the expenditures for extraordinary repairs
alone on our canals have amounted, since 1867, to $8,444,827.24,
or to nearly as much as the whole of our canal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
debt, less the sinking fund, which on the 30th of September,
1875, was $8,638,314.49? Of these expenditures for extraordinary
repairs it is our belief that fully seventy per
cent. have been inconsiderate, unwise, and unprofitable to
the State.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>"The facts which have been brought to light in the course
of this investigation have constrained us already to recommend
rigorous proceedings to be taken against the following
parties:</p>

<p>"First.&mdash;Against Denison, Belden &amp; Co. for the recovery
of large sums of money which they appear to have received
unlawfully under their contracts for work between Port
Schuyler and the lower Mohawk aqueduct, and for work east
of the city of Utica, both on the Erie Canal. The claims of
the State against these parties are fully set forth in the
first and second reports of this commission to the Governor,
and suits are in progress.</p>

<p>"Second.&mdash;George D. Lord has been indicted by a grand
jury of Erie County, upon the facts disclosed by this commission,
for bribery in procuring an act of the Legislature
for the relief of one John Hand. The history of this case
will be found in the fifth report of this commission to the
Governor.</p>

<p>"Third.&mdash;Thaddeus C. Davis, late member of the Board
of Canal Appraisers, has also been indicted for a conspiracy
to cheat the State. The circumstances which made him
amenable to the criminal courts are set forth in the fifth,
seventh, and eighth reports of this commission to the Governor.</p>

<p>"A civil suit has also been instituted against Davis to
recover moneys fraudulently obtained from the State by
himself in conjunction with George D. Lord.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fourth.&mdash;Indictments have also been found upon the
testimony furnished by the commission against the following
other high officials: Alexander Barkley, ex-canal commissioner;
John Kelly, late superintendent of section No.
12 of the Erie Canal; J. Frederick Behn, division engineer
of the western section; and D. Clinton Welch, ex-superintendent
of section No. 12.</p>

<p>"Fifth.&mdash;Upon testimony furnished by this commission,
the commissioners of the canal fund made a requisition upon
the Governor for the removal of Francis S. Thayer, late
Auditor of the Canal Department, and on the twenty-eighth
day of December last Mr. Thayer was suspended upon
charges of unlawfully trafficking in canal certificates and
violating his duty as auditor 'in respect to the public
moneys in his charge and subject to his draft.' The charges
preferred by the commission upon which the commissioners
of the canal fund and the Governor acted, together with
their proceedings thereon, respectively, are hereunto annexed.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
The testimony by which these charges were established
will be found in volume three of the accompanying

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span></p>

<p>"Large as these sums appear, we are fully impressed
with the belief that they form but a fraction of the amount
that is due to the State from similar sources.</p>

<p>"For the purpose of ascertaining more precisely the extent
of this class of liabilities, and to protect the State in
future from the irregularities and improvidence out of
which they have arisen, we recommend that the Canal Board
be clothed with ample powers and authority for taking testimony.</p>

<p>"A perusal of the testimony and the reports to the Executive
herewith submitted clearly establish the fact that
our canals are a burden to the States less, perhaps, through
the imperfection of our laws, than the mode in which they
have been administered.</p>

<p>"Every appropriation for new work and extraordinary
repairs on the canals for the six years from 1867 to 1873
contained a provision that no part or portion of the money
therein appropriated 'for new work or work on change of
plan' should be expended or paid, nor any contract involving
such expenditure and payment be made on behalf of the
States, until the maps, plans, and estimates of such new work
had been submitted to and approved by the Canal Board.</p>

<p>"There has been a law on the statute-books since 1850,
yet more stringent, which provides that 'before any work
shall be contracted for on any canals of the State the division
engineer shall cause to be ascertained, with all practical
accuracy, the quantity of embankment, excavation,
and masonry, and the quality and quantity of all materials
to be used, and all other items of work to be placed under
contract, a statement of which, together with maps, plans,
and specifications corresponding with those adopted by the
Canal Board, and on file in the office of the State Engineer
and Surveyor, shall be publicly exhibited to persons proposing
for work to be let.'</p>

<p>"These most explicit provisions of law have been very
rarely observed. Contracts have not only been let without
the preliminary surveys, maps, plans, and estimates, but
one of the most familiar abuses on the canals of late years
has been to change the plan of work after the contract is
signed, by which the contractor gets relieved from the unprofitable
portions of his work, and is furnished a pretext
for establishing a new scale of prices, in connivance with
the auditing officers. Illustrations of this method of defrauding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
the State may be found in several of the reports
submitted to the Executive. The most costly one to the
State is described in our first report. The contract for substituting
slope and vertical wall for the bench wall between
the Port Schuyler and the lower Mohawk aqueduct provided
originally for 14,000 cubic yards of slope wall and only
9000 of vertical wall. As if distrustful of the influence of
the contractor over its own agents, the Legislature, within
six months after the time this work could have begun, in
appropriating money to carry it on, absolutely prohibited
the expenditure of more than five per cent. of the appropriation
for vertical wall. Regardless, however, of this restriction,
and regardless of the terms of the contract which
provided for twice as much slope as vertical wall, nearly
ninety-five per cent. of the cost of the work on that contract
was incurred upon vertical wall and work incident to such
construction, while not a single yard of slope wall was built;
and as a consequence, an improvement which could have
been readily and well done for the original appropriation
of $84,645 has already cost the State about half a million
for wretched work, and is still far from completion. No
attention was ever paid to the provision of the act requiring
the change of plan from slope to vertical wall, with the
maps, plans, and estimates for such new work to be submitted
to and approved by the Canal Board, and advertised
and let to the lowest bidder.</p>

<p>"Nor does the infidelity of the State's agents appear to
have stopped here. While the records of the canal commissioners
and of the Canal Board certify that the preliminary
surveys, maps, plans, specifications, estimates, etc., required
by law were actually produced before them and approved
by them and by the State Engineer; in point of fact, no
such precautions for the protection of the State, so far as
we have been able to ascertain, were actually taken.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>"It is obvious that the abuses to which we have invited
your attention cannot be remedied except:</p>

<p>"<i>First</i>, by concentrating responsibility for the administration
of the canals in fewer hands;</p>

<p>"<i>Second</i>, by lodging somewhere a more efficient power
for the suspension or removal of offenders;</p>

<p>"<i>Third</i>, by providing more specific, complete, and efficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
laws for preventing and punishing abuses when disclosed;
and,</p>

<p>"<i>Fourth</i>, by providing for the vigorous prosecution and
punishment of unfaithful servants.</p>

<p>"Under the present organization the responsibility for
a non-compliance with the provisions of the laws for the
repair and maintenance of the canals is so distributed between
nine State officers, composing the Canal Board, and
the auditor, the superintendents, the division, resident and
assistant Engineers, that it is nearly impossible to bring
any one of them to justice, unless all, or at least a large
majority, are of accord in that purpose. Could one person
be held responsible for the acts of all of his subordinates,
the remedy would be simple and probably adequate. Should
the people ratify the proposed amendment of the Constitution,
which is designed to clothe a new officer, to be called
Superintendent of Public Works, with the powers now
vested in the canal commissioners, together with other
powers necessary to his functions, this evil of divided responsibility
will be greatly diminished. At present the
powers of removal and suspension of unfaithful officers are
altogether inadequate.</p>

<p>"We recommend, in addition, that the division and resident
engineers, and such others engineers as it may be necessary,
in the opinion of the State Engineer and Surveyor,
to employ temporarily upon any particular work, should be
appointed by the State Engineer and Surveyor, with the
approval of the Canal Board, subject to removal by the State
Engineer and Surveyor alone. In case of every such temporary
employment, we would recommend that the rate of
compensation be fixed by the Canal Board before such person
employed enters upon duty; that he be required to file
the usual oath of office, and that he be only paid by the
auditor of the Canal Department upon his oath to the correctness
of the items charged for expenses and time, and a
certificate of the approval of the State Engineer and Surveyor
attached.</p>

<p>"No modification of the Constitution or of the law,
however, will ever work any substantial reform unless adequate
provision is made in some way for a more vigorous
prosecution of unfaithful servants. The law is no protection
unless its penalties are enforced against those who violate
it; the justice that sleeps might as well be dead. Had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
the laws been enforced promptly when they had been notoriously
violated, our canals would not only now be out of debt,
but a fruitful source of revenue to the State. It is our
conviction that the Legislature will do well to see if this
arm of the government ought not to be strengthened. The
evidence here submitted will show that very large sums of
money have been taken annually from the State by the
fraudulent connivance of the State agents with contractors,
which should be reclaimed and restored to the treasury and
an example made of all the parties participating in the robberies.
The preparation of the testimony in these prosecutions,
covering, as it must in most cases, a series of years, the
actions of a large number of public officers, and servants, and
involving a scientific examination of great varieties of work
and a familiarity with the principles of engineering and the
field work of the engineers, and with the accounts preserved
in our public archives, will involve an amount of labor and
expense for which at present there is no adequate provision.</p>

<p>"The commission was occupied in the taking of testimony
until after the present session of the Legislature had
commenced. The testimony could not be written out by the
stenographer and put into the hands of the printer until
the latter part of the month of January. This will explain
any apparent delay in the transmission of this report, there
being obvious inconveniences in sending part in print and
part in manuscript. There has been no delay in its preparation,
except what was the natural and inevitable result of
efforts of the commission to render its contents readily accessible
to your Excellency and to the legislative bodies.</p>

<p>"For the expenses of the commission the sum of $30,000
was appropriated by the last Legislature. The expenses
will exceed this sum about $5000, for which we respectfully
ask an appropriation. For greater convenience in presenting
the testimony taken, we had it printed at a cost of over
$4000. This, together with the legal expenses growing out
of the proceedings to establish the authority of the commission
to compel the production of books and papers and the
witnesses to testify, occasioned this deficiency.</p>

<h3>"EXHIBIT D.</h3>

<p>"The commission to investigate the affairs of the canals
of the State present to the honorable commissioners of the
canal fund:</p>

<p>"That Hon. Francis S. Thayer, Auditor of the Canal
Department, has violated his duty as such auditor 'in
respect to the public moneys in his charge and subject to his
draft':</p>

<p>"<i>First.</i>&mdash;In that, on the 21st day of July, 1874, he procured
the passage of a resolution by the commissioners of the
canal fund whereby $200,000 of the sinking fund was directed
to be invested in the taxes to be levied pursuant to
chapter 462 of the laws of 1874; and after procuring the
passage of such resolution did set apart said sum in violation
of the Constitution. That the auditor's motive was to benefit
George D. Lord. That in carrying out such intent the
auditor paid $120,497.02 of said sum of $200,000, so set
apart, within two days thereafter to Thad. C. Davis, as the
agent of George D. Lord. That this was a violation of the
Constitution, see article seven, sections two and thirteen.
That the auditor is responsible for this misapplication of
money, see his testimony, pages 2544, 2546.</p>

<p>"<i>Second.</i>&mdash;In that, on or about the 1st day of December,
1874, there being money subject to the warrant of the auditor
for that purpose, the said auditor refused payment to
S. R. Wells, administrator, of an award in his favor for
$5207.50 on the false pretence that he had no funds, and
immediately after such refusal negotiated the purchase, and
did purchase, the said award at about $200 less than it called
for of principal and interest, and on the 9th day of February,
1875, audited the said claim at the sum of $5454.92,
and drew his warrant therefor in favor of George A. Stone,
as assignee.</p>

<p>"George A. Stone had no interest in the transaction, and
the auditor testifies that it was purchased for his brother-in-law,
E. J. McKie. As to the evidence of this charge, see
testimony of S. R. Wells, page 37 (folio 513 to folio 517);
testimony of D. Willers, Jr., page 42 (folios 571 and 572);
testimony of the auditor, pages 2507-2511; that the profit
went to the benefit of the auditor, see pages 2595.</p>

<p>"<i>Third.</i>&mdash;In that, on the 11th day of March, 1875, there
being money subject to the warrant of the auditor for that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
purpose, the said auditor refused payment to George M.
Case of an award in his favor for $9768.71, on the false
pretence that he had no funds, and, immediately after such
refusal, negotiated the purchase, and did purchase, the said
award, including accrued interest, at $10,510.73, and did
on the twentieth day of May thereafter audit said claim for
the full amount thereof, including interest, to wit, $10,730.60,
and drew his warrant therefor in favor of George
A. Stone, assignee.</p>

<p>"George A. Stone had no interest in the purchase, as appeared
by his testimony, pages 2160-2229, and the auditor
testified that he made the purchase for his brother-in-law,
E. J. McKie.</p>

<p>"As to the evidence, see testimony of Auditor Thayer,
pages 2507, 2586, 2595.</p>

<p>"<i>Fourth.</i>&mdash;In that, on the 15th day of March, 1875, the
auditor purchased a certificate in favor of E. H. French
for $1184.26 at a discount of $24.64. It was paid May
twentieth thereafter at its full face. As to evidence of this
transaction, see testimony of Auditor Thayer, same pages
and folios referred to above as to George M. Case's certificate.</p>

<p>"<i>Fifth.</i>&mdash;In that, on the 12th day of April, 1875, the
auditor purchased sixteen canal commissioners' certificates,
amounting in the aggregate to $29,962, from Nehemiah L.
Osborne at a discount of seven per cent. per annum from
the face thereof, but for what length of time the discount
was made we are unable to ascertain, further than that the
time was in excess of the time between the purchase and
payment by the auditor.</p>

<p>"These certificates were paid May 20, 1875, to George A.
Stone. That the auditor derived a personal advantage from
this transaction, see testimony of George A. Stone and of
Auditor Thayer, pages 2229, 2595.</p>

<p>"<i>Sixth.</i>&mdash;In that, on the 28th day of April, 1875, the
auditor purchased from H. D. Denison five canal commissioners'
certificates, of the aggregate amount of $49,610,
at a discount of seven per cent. per annum, but for what
time he discounted them we have not been able to ascertain,
further than that it was in excess of the time between the
purchase and payment. On the twentieth day of May
thereafter the auditor audited said certificates and drew his
warrant for the payment thereof in favor of George A. Stone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
assignee, at $50,542.06, and the amount gained went to the
personal advantage of the auditor. As to evidence of this
transaction, see testimony of George A. Stone, page 2229;
Francis S. Thayer, page 2476.</p>

<p>"<i>Seventh.</i>&mdash;In that, on the 29th day of April, 1875, the
auditor purchased from H. D. Denison six canal commissioners'
certificates, of the aggregate amount of $30,687, at
a discount of seven per cent. per annum, but for what length
of time he discounted them we have not been able to ascertain,
further than that it was greater than the time between
the purchase and payment; that on the twentieth day of
May thereafter the auditor audited these certificates and
drew his warrant therefor in favor of George A. Stone at
$31,153.03. That the personal gain from this transaction
went to the personal advantage of Francis S. Thayer, see
his testimony, page 2595.</p>

<p>"<i>Eighth.</i>&mdash;That the auditor drew his warrant in payment
for a canal commissioners' certificate, in favor of John
D. Hamilton, for $38,000, on the 28th day of June, 1875,
in violation of law in this: that he paid it without the sworn
certificate of an engineer, as required by statute.</p>

<p>"<i>Ninth.</i>&mdash;In this, that the auditor, in June, 1875, purchased
a canal commissioners' certificate, subject to his own
audit, from James P. Buck, for $6496.28, at a discount of
ten per cent. For the evidence of specification, see testimony
of James P. Buck, page 2216.</p>

<p>"The auditor claims he made this purchase for his
brother-in-law, E. J. McKie.</p>

<p>"<i>Tenth.</i>-In this, that on the 2d day of July, 1875, the
auditor purchased canal commissioners' certificates, subject
to his own audit, to the amount of $49,953.91, at a discount
of eight per cent. and accrued interest, in favor of the purchaser.
For evidence of this purchase, see testimony of
Willard Johnson, page 2386; testimony of F. S. Thayer,
page 2514.</p>

<p>"<i>Eleventh.</i>&mdash;In that, in addition to those above enumerated,
the auditor purchased, between the 9th day of March
and the 14th day of July, 1875, canal commissioners' drafts
and certificates, subject to his own audit, to the amount of
$64,959.81, all of which he afterward audited and drew his
warrants in payment thereof. As to the evidence of these
several transactions, see testimony of George A. Stone, page
2241; that the auditor derived a direct personal advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>

<h2>"MR. TILDEN AND THE DEMOCRATS</h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">[<i>From the New York "Tribune" (Republican) of May 27, 1876.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p>"Mr. Tilden is by no means the only Democrat at the
East whom good citizens might rejoice to see nominated for
the Presidency. His name would undoubtedly do honor
to the ticket to be made at St. Louis; but it is not essential
to the credit of the party, and if some of his own political
brethren are bitterly opposed to him, that is, in one sense,
a family affair, over which the outside world need not greatly
vex itself. As an indication of the tendencies of the
Democratic party, however, the causes of the hostility to
Tilden becomes a matter of national concern. The first serious
manifestation of enmity came from Tammany Hall,
and it finds expression in the columns of the <cite>Express</cite>, where
it is alleged that Gov. Tilden has made use of his position
to organize a personal party. But this is such a strange complaint
to come from the Tammany Hall autocracy that there
must be something more behind it. The <cite>World</cite>, whose
change of proprietorship is generally interpreted as a blow
at Mr. Tilden's pretensions, has not a word to say against
the Governor; it only insists, with good sense and good temper,
that there are other eminent Democrats whose merits
and whose chances are entitled to consideration. But on
Wednesday a conference of leading Democratic politicians
was held at Albany to consider how Mr. Tilden could be
most conveniently thrown overboard, and from them it
would seem that we ought to obtain some light upon the interesting
question which neither the <cite>World</cite>, nor the <cite>Express</cite>,
nor Tammany has seen fit to answer. There were present
at this conference Chief-Justice Church and Justice Allen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
ex-Lieut.-Gov. Beach, ex-Gov. Hoffman, ex-Speaker Littlejohn,
and other well-known men, and the judgment of the
meeting is understood to have been unanimous that Mr. Tilden,
having alienated a large faction of the Democracy, is
not the man for St. Louis.</p>

<p>"We mean no reflection upon the integrity of any of these
estimable gentlemen, but it is a significant fact that pretty
nearly all the most reputable Democrats whose names have
been, either rightly or wrongly, connected with the Tweed
and Canal Rings, were found on Wednesday in their company.
It was probably not the fault of Judge Church and
Judge Allen that the Canal Ring and what was left of the
old Tammany Ring united in 1874 to run them both against
Tilden, first one and then the other, in the canvass for the
nomination; but it was certainly their misfortune. That
fight of the Rings against Tilden was a matter of notoriety,
and the nomination of our present Governor, instead of Judge
Church or his cousin, Judge Allen, was generally recognized
throughout the State as a triumph of the better elements of
the Democracy over the thieves and corruptionists. It seems
to be the same fight that is renewed now. Judge Allen is
known as the author of the much-criticised decision of the
Court of Appeals which released Tweed from Blackwell's
Island. Mr. Beach is remembered as the gentleman who
made such a strange exhibition of himself last Summer by
publishing a card in which he intemperately denounced a
report of the canal investigating commission as "unfounded
in every particular," and who then, being subp&oelig;naed by
the commission, swallowed his card and convicted himself
of official neglect out of his own mouth. The
history and affiliations of ex-Gov. Hoffman are well enough
known.</p>

<p>"Altogether, it may be said that the Albany conference
only brought to the front the men who have always been
recognized as Governor Tilden's enemies and rivals, and
who, from their peculiar positions, could not be his friends,
not because they are not personally good men, but because
a reform movement cannot be carried on in New York without
hurting their allies and adherents. And if we go outside
the State we find the anti-Tilden sentiment confined to the
Western inflationists and communists, who hate every man
that believes in a dollar, and are perfectly frank in the declaration
of their sentiments. Now, as we have said before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
the Democratic party is not so poor that it can name no one
for the Presidency whose fitness is not so marked as Mr.
Tilden's; but if he is to be thrown overboard the country
has a right to insist that the reasons for his rejection shall
be made quite clear; otherwise it is sure to draw unpleasant
conclusions. The Democratic candidate, whoever he may be,
must be a man whom repudiators, canal thieves, and the
relics of the old Tammany cannot support."</p>


<h2>THE FIFTH AVENUE HOTEL CONFERENCE OF 1876</h2>


<p class="center">[<cite>From the "Sun," April 7, 1900.</cite>]</p>

<p>"A man with half a memory writes a long letter to the
<cite>Evening Post</cite> of this city recalling the circumstances of the
once-famous Fifth Avenue Hotel Conference of May, 1876.
He thinks the political situation is ripe for another such
demonstration on the part of eminent citizens who do not
want to vote for McKinley again, yet view with apprehension
the probability that Bryan will be the alternative
choice. There is as much time now before the two great
nominating conventions, he points out, as there was when
Carl Schurz and others met in the Fifth Avenue Hotel to
save the country. A quarter of a century has considerably
idealized his mental picture of that conference and its results.
This is his description of it now:</p>

<p>"'It was a gathering of the foremost patriots in the nation,
regardless of party affiliations, to discuss the political
situation and suggest to the country a programme for the
Presidential canvass which was soon to begin. There were
philosophers and scholars of the first rank, eminent lawyers,
and brilliant editors, and men who had won renown
in many a fierce campaign as "practical" politicians and
popular leaders. The call which brought them together distinctly
disavowed the idea of nominating a candidate or
framing a platform, except, possibly, in the barest outlines.
The whole purpose of the conference was to end at one
stroke some of the false conditions against which the conscience
and intelligence of the country were in revolt, but
not to pull down anything for which it was not prepared
to offer something better as a substitute.'</p>

<p>"This conference to which the writer in the <cite>Evening Post</cite>
refers in terms of reverence, amounting almost to awe, met
at the Fifth Avenue Hotel on May 16, 1876, in response<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
to a call signed by Mr. Schurz and a few others. There
were present about two hundred gentlemen, mostly of the
type which afterward came to be known as the Mugwump;
that is to say, the type addicted to proclaiming its superior
intelligence and conscience in political affairs. As might
be expected, the Hon. Carl Schurz, the Flying Dutchman of
American politics, was the most conspicuous figure. He
made the principal speech, and he was chairman of the committee
which prepared and reported a pretentious 'address
to the country.' This address to the country constituted
the sole fruit of the conference's deliberations.</p>

<p>"Let us supplement the half-memory of the man who
wants another such demonstration of the foremost patriots,
philosophers, and scholars, under the leadership once more,
as we assume from the tone of his letter, of the Hon. Carl
Schurz. At the time the conference met there was nothing
murky in the political situation. On the Republican side
the nomination of Governor Hayes, of Ohio, was clearly indicated.
The <cite>Sun</cite> had predicted it long before the patriots
and philosophers assembled. Mr. Blaine was an aggressive
candidate, and there was some third-term talk about Gen.
Grant; but the Conkling-Blaine feud and the Bristow disaffection
already rendered practically certain the nomination
of a compromise candidate not identified with either
faction, and the logic of the situation pointed directly to
Governor Hayes. On the other side everything was shaping
towards the event which occurred at St. Louis six weeks
later, the nomination on the second ballot, by far more than
the required two-thirds majority, of Samuel J. Tilden, a
statesman and reformer representing with singular closeness
the ideal which was declared to be in the minds of Mr.
Carl Schurz and his associates.</p>

<p>"That celebrated address which Mr. Schurz drafted, with
the assistance of the intelligence and conscience of the country,
could scarcely have called more pointedly for Tilden
and barred out Hayes as the President desired by the foremost
patriots, philosophers, and scholars, had it mentioned
their names. We quote from Mr. Carl Schurz's address to
the country:</p>

<p>"'We shall support no candidate who, however favorably
judged by his nearest friends, is not publicly known to possess
those qualities of mind and character which the stern
task of genuine reform requires, for the American people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
cannot now afford to risk the future of the republic in
experiments on merely supposed virtue or rumored ability
to be trusted on the strength of private recommendations.</p>

<p>"'The man to be intrusted with the Presidency this year
must have deserved not only the confidence of honest men,
but also the fear and hatred of the thieves.</p>

<p>"'The country must now have a President whose name
is already a watchword of reform, whose capacity and
courage for the work are matters of record rather than
promise.'</p>

<p>"There was much more of the same sort in the address
which Mr. Schurz signed and the Fifth Avenue Hotel conference
issued. Within a few weeks the Republican party
nominated the man whose capacity and courage for the work
of reform were matters of promise only, and the Democracy
put up the statesman already publicly known to possess
those qualities of mind and character which the stern task
of genuine reform required.</p>

<p>"What was the sequel? A few weeks later the Hon. Carl
Schurz, the author of all the high-sounding professions in
the address to the country, was hard at work persuading
citizens of the Mugwump type to cast their votes for Hayes
and against Tilden; and a few months later, after Mr.
Hayes had failed to secure a majority of the electoral vote,
but had been counted into the office to which Mr. Tilden was
elected, the Hon. Carl Schurz, reformer and leader of the
Fifth Avenue Hotel conference, got his pay for partisan
activity; it came in the shape of a Cabinet appointment,
which he promptly accepted.</p>

<p>"Such is the true story of the May conference of 1876."</p>


<h2>JOHN T. MORGAN TO MONTGOMERY BLAIR</h2>

<p>
"<i>Confidential.</i></p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Selma, Ala.</span>, <i>June 3d, 1876</i>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Hon. Montgomery Blair.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have had two valued favors from you&mdash;the
last of 25th May. I was chosen as a State elector, and
also as a State delegate to St. Louis by our recent convention.
It was very large, fully representative, unusually able, and
harmonious. The delegation to St. Louis is very able, comprising
many of our best men. No instructions were given.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
I did not even hear much discussion of candidates. The
great leading thought is success, and to gain this every man
will sacrifice all his preferences for any particular candidate.
I think I may state safely (but I do it in personal
confidence) that not more than two of our twenty delegates
favor now the nomination of any other person but Mr.
Tilden. One of these stated to the convention that he was
under no pledges to any man. This state of opinion is the
result of close scrutiny of the drift of sentiment in the
Northern States, and especially in New York. The recent
movement of Church and Kelly and others has deceived no
one here.</p>

<p>"I am satisfied that Alabama will be very reluctant to
take such a lead as would have the appearance of dictating
the candidate to the Northern States. The North ought to
settle its differences about the minor and purely political
question of currency laws and allow us to unite with them
in demanding a pure government which will give them a
chance for life. If they force us to choose, however, we will
certainly be directed solely by the consideration of 'success.'
We can't afford to risk anything to gratify a predilection.
If you could, Bayard would get the State. I was at
Montgomery at the time you refer to as a member of the
convention of 1861. I do not remember that Mr. Bayard
was there. I feel satisfied he was not there.</p>

<p>"As his friend I would prefer to see him wait a time and
mature more thoroughly his great powers in the school of
experience. Still, he would now be a most acceptable President
to all the people of the Southern States.</p>

<p>"My conviction remains unshaken that Mr. Tilden is the
strongest man in N. Y.; that he is an honest Democrat
from principle; that he acts squarely on his convictions in
everything; that his record is one to inspire confidence in
the people; that he will attack fraud and corruption wherever
he meets them, without fear or hesitancy; and that his
good sense, and the best interests of his own State, will lead
him to give to the country with which the great commercial
cities are so intimately associated in the means of prosperity,
<em>peace and protection</em>, while it is working out with honest
toil its redemption from poverty and distress. This is all
we need. We do not wish the power that springs merely
from the weight of numbers in the electoral colleges. We
wish no offices, or, rather, we need none, and our wisest men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
will be glad if we get but few. Let us alone, and we will
soon become richer than we have ever been.</p>

<p>"Genl. E. W. Peters, who is Col. Denison's law partner,
is in our delegation, and will probably be our chairman.
He is a hard-money Democrat, and is much impressed with
the necessity of Mr. Tilden's nomination as a matter of success.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the 28th of June the Democratic National Convention
at St. Louis nominated Mr. Tilden for President.</p>

<p>The whole vote on the second ballot was 738; necessary
to a choice, 492. Tilden had 535; Hendricks, of Indiana,
66; Allen, of Ohio, 54; Parker, of New Jersey, 18; Hancock,
of Pennsylvania, 59; Bayard, of Delaware, 11; Thurman,
of Ohio, 2. Indiana seconded Pennsylvania's motion
to make Mr. Tilden's nomination unanimous, and it was
adopted.</p>

<p>In the month of June, 1876, Governor Tilden received a
note from a citizen of Minnesota complaining that he could
get no evidence of any success achieved by the Governor in
his war upon the Canal Ring, and that it was thrown in the
face of the people out there that nothing had been accomplished.
His letter concludes as follows: "Now, if ever
I have seen any disposition of these cases of corruption it
has escaped my memory, and to be prepared to answer our
assailants on their only one point, with an earnest desire
to convert them to Tilden and reform, is solely the object
of my writing."</p>

<p>To this letter Tilden wrote the following reply, dated
June 15, 1876: "Your letter of June 12th has been handed
to me. In reply, I would like to state that it takes time to
obtain the evidence and prepare the actions, civil and criminal,
in such cases as those against the members of the Canal
Ring. The machinery of justice under the State government
has not the unity and efficiency that it has under the
Federal government, where the district attorneys and marshals
are appointed by the Chief Executive instead of being
elected in their localities. On the whole, however, these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
cases have proceeded with more rapidity than could have
been expected under the circumstances. You will have become,
doubtless, aware before this reaches you that George
D. Lord was convicted a few days since at Buffalo. The
principal civil suit against Beldon, Denison &amp; Co. is set
down for trial on the 12th of July. The trial was put off
for a few weeks by the court against the opposition of the
Attorney-General. The most important thing, of course,
was to break up the system, and that has been done. A
secondary object is to deter from the commission of similar
offences in future, and that work is going on satisfactorily."</p>

<h2>ROBERT B. MINTURN TO TILDEN</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">New Brighton, Staten Island</span>, <i>July 3, 1876</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Governor Tilden</span>,&mdash;No one has been more
delighted than I by your nomination; and you, knowing
how much I have desired it, may have been surprised at not
receiving any word of congratulation from me.</p>

<p>"The truth is that, at a time when the mails and the
wires have been burdened with messages of felicitation for
you, it seemed that you would scarcely care to have any formal
expression from those of whose regard and support you
were already assured. I may have been wrong in this feeling,
and perhaps I should at once have written to tell you
how much I was rejoiced at your nomination, and how thoroughly
I have admired your noble fight against the worst
constituents of our politics&mdash;culminating in your victory, at
the St. Louis convention, over all the jobbing elements of the
party, which were strengthened by a most unprecedented and
venomous opposition from your own State.</p>

<p>"My gratification at your nomination has, however (I
must confess), been mingled with deep regret at the phrase
in the platform which denounces the resumption clause of
the act of 1875. I know as well as any one the fraudulent
character of that act&mdash;I know that the Cincinnati convention
refused to endorse it&mdash;but, nevertheless, I feel that it was a
solemn pledge of the national faith, a pledge which cannot
be repudiated without discredit, not to say, disgrace.</p>

<p>"The act of 1875 was a settlement&mdash;unsatisfactory and
inadequate, no doubt&mdash;but still a settlement which, in every
point of view, should (as it seems to me) be respected. If
present legislation is inadequate to carry it into effect, fresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
legislation should be provided. If the time that remains
is now too short to make effectual provision for resumption,
the period should be extended to admit of proper preparation.
But to say (as the platform does) that the resumption clause
is itself an obstacle to resumption, and to propose its naked
repeal, is (as it seems to me) to talk nonsense, and, what is
worse, very dishonorable and disgraceful nonsense.</p>

<p>"Knowing how thoroughly sound you are on this subject,
I cannot but believe that you will take some occasion (probably
in your letter of acceptance) to relieve yourself and
your supporters from the odium of permitting the phrase to
pass without explanation. I observe that Mr. Hendricks exults
in the expression, as being equivalent to an abandonment
of any policy looking towards resumption by the government.
But the phrase is capable of receiving a different
interpretation, as was shown by one of the Ohio delegates
in the convention, who said that it might be taken to express
a disapproval of the resumption clause only because
it did not contain sufficiently vigorous provisions for a sufficiently
early resumption. But if nothing should be said by
you, I am satisfied that the interpretation of Mr. Hendricks
is the sense which will be affixed to the platform both by
friends and foes; and it is a sense which (in my judgment)
will do very great harm, and, indeed, is already working
mischief.</p>

<p>"I trust that you will not consider it impertinent in me
to write thus strongly and with so much frankness. I feel
very strongly that the conservative sentiment of this country
will not willingly see the settlement of 1875 rudely and
thoughtlessly repudiated; and I am confident that not only
is this the real feeling of the country, but that it is a noble
and honorable sentiment which cannot with impunity be
disregarded by those who represent a reform of politics.</p>

<p>"You may be very sure, my dear Mr. Tilden, that if I
had not a very genuine confidence in you, and an earnest
desire for your success, I should not have ventured to write
you thus. Pray take this view of my letter, and believe me,</p>

them in some of their final preparations in sailing again for
Europe. You know they took my niece over, returned with
her to nurse her, went with me to the West to bury her, and
are now just starting back to try to get up their own health
again.</p>

<p>"I would like very much to talk over the political situation
with you. I am exceedingly sorry that the Hendricks
nomination and the platform seem to shut us up to the support
of Hayes. At the same time, I feel like congratulating
the independent press and honest men of all parties on the
great reform they have succeeded in securing in forcing unobjectionable
nominations from the Republicans, and compelling
the Democrats to take Tilden. It does not seem to me
by any means clear that he will not be elected. If he is we
ought all to pray night and day that his health may be preserved
to protect us against Hendricks.</p>

<h2>GEORGE TICKNOR CURTIS TO GOVERNOR TILDEN</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <i>July 10, '76</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Gov. Hayes leaves to you a clear field.
Since reading his letter I am the more confirmed in the
views which I hurriedly expressed on Saturday. You now
have a great opportunity to do two things: first, to make the
country see that the resumption of specie payments means
<em>measures</em>, and not <em>barren promises</em>; that the attitude of the
Republicans in regard to specie payments is like the attitude
of the government in regard to its notes&mdash;the holder asks
for payment, and he gets another paper promise; the country
asks to have specie payments restored, and it gets the
law wh. says it shall be done in 1879, but takes no step
towards a fulfilment of the pledge. Secondly, you now
have a grand opportunity to show the inflationists of our
own party that they indulge a false alarm about contraction;
that the very gist of the problem is to avoid contraction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
that will hurt anybody by putting the finances of the
govt. into a condition to supply a circulating medium that
will appreciate in value from the moment of the enactment
of the very first measure, and will go on appreciating until
it becomes at par with gold in the market and in the purchasing
and paying power.</p>

<p>"Let the people see that you are not, as your rival certainly
is, a mere puppet in the hands of others. Speak,
speak as if <em>ex-cathedra</em>; for your position is now one that
will cause anything you say, that appears to come from
<em>conscious power to handle the subject</em>, to sink deep in the
public mind. Your opponent not only shows no such conscious
power, but he shows that he possesses no more of it
than a child; in which respect, indeed, he is a good average
representative of his party. Now is your time to strike a
blow that will be felt.</p>

<h2>TILDEN TO S. S. COX</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">State of New York, Executive Chamber</span>,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Albany</span>, <i>July 22, 1876</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Cox</span>,&mdash;Your note of the 15th came several
days ago, but I have since that time been so exceptionally
occupied that I could not give any attention to my correspondence.</p>

<p>"I did, however, immediately direct the messages you
desired to be at once sent, and I now will answer your inquiry
in respect to the statement of Federal taxation for the
year 1870, contained in my last annual message.</p>

<p>"The year taken is that which ends on the 30th of June,
1870, being most nearly identical with that in which and
for which the census statements are made.</p>

<p>"The statement is of taxation and not of expenditures.
All the statements in the comparative tables are of taxation.
In the long run, unfortunately, the expenditures equal the taxes.
At any rate, the comparison is a comparison of taxation.</p>

<p>"If you will refer to the first page of the report of the
Secretary of the Treasury for December 5, 1870, you will
find the receipts for the year ending June 30, 1870, stated
as follows:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="receipts">
<tr><td align="left">From customs (in gold)</td><td align="right">$194,538,374 44</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">From internal revenues</td><td align="right">185,128,859 07</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">From sales of public lands</td><td align="right">3,350,481 76</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">From miscellaneous sources</td><td align="right"><span class="bb">28,237,762 06</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total</td><td align="right">$411,255,477 33</td></tr>
</table></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"To reduce the gold revenue from the customs to currency
requires the addition of the premium on gold. The
gentleman to whom I intrusted that computation made an
average which fixed the premium at 24 per cent. That is
no doubt considerably below the real premium at the times
when the revenues were collected.</p>

<p>"The amount of the premium is $46,689,209.86. From
that should be deducted premium received on the sales of
gold which form the larger part of the 28,000,000 of receipts
from miscellaneous sources, and amount to $15,294,137.37,
leaving a balance of $31,395,072.49&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span></p>

<p>"The estimate of the amount drawn from the people by
taxation by the Federal government, contained in the table
to which you refer, is made in round numbers $450,000,000.</p>

<p>"There can be no doubt it is below the truth.</p>

measure of repeal.</p>

<h2>ABRAM S. HEWITT TO TILDEN</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">House of Representatives</span>, <i>July 26th, 1867</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Governor</span>,&mdash;We have got over another day,
thanks to an election case, without action on the silver bill.
We believe now that we shall be able to defeat action, if not
vote down the measure. It has been a hard fight, and, if we
win, it will be due to considerations of expediency rather
than of principles on the part of the Southern members.</p>

<p>"The object of this note is mainly to suggest something
in regard to the civil-service plank. A very intelligent newspaper
man says that the real issue is not so much in the
personnel of the clerks as in the modes and machinery of
administration in the several departments of the Govt. In
other words, that the abuses are largely due to the defective
organization of the department, that the business has outgrown
the methods and machinery devised by Hamilton,
and that it is the framework of the government machine
which needs reformation, reconstruction, and adaptation to
the requirements of the public business. In this view, the
mere appointment and discharge of a few clerks is of but
little consequence, compared with such a reform in the mode
of conducting the public business.</p>

<p>"This crude statement seems to contain the germ of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
position in politics in regard to civil service, far higher and
more practical than the declaration of Hayes.</p>

<p>"The P. S. dept. may be instanced to illustrate the state
of affairs. When it was a small affair it was not of such
consequence, and before the days of railroads and telegraphs
indispensable, perhaps, that it should use its receipts
to pay its expenses and pay over to the Treasury any balance
that might remain at the end of the fiscal year. Now, however,
when the receipts are very great, they should be paid
all into the Treasury, and the expenses drawn thence by warrant,
as in other departments of the government. This is
not the case, but the Postmaster-General, having the control
of the money, authorizes and allows expenditures, such as
repairs and improvements to buildings, amounting to large
sums, without any authority from Congress, such as is necessary
in the other departments for such outlays.</p>

<p>"So the bookkeeping of the government is not in accordance
with the experience of the times, but is crude, old-fashioned,
unsatisfactory, and even contradictory. Now a
broad declaration from you that you will endeavor to reform
these abuses which are of a gravity far greater than
the incompetence or negligence of clerks, and that this reform
is the most urgent and will receive careful attention
would, I think, strike the public favorably.</p>

<p>"Scott Wicks, of Ill., one of our best members, and who
stood by us on the banking and currency committee, has lost
his renomination in consequence. It is a severe blow to him
and to me, and if we win he must be taken care of. He is
a first-class man.</p>

<p>"I do not think you begin to appreciate the bitterness of
these Western inflationists."</p>


<h2>ABRAM S. HEWITT TO TILDEN</h2>

<p>
"<i>Personal and private.</i></p>

<p class="sig">"<span class="smcap">Sunday, 8 P.M., Washington</span>, <i>Aug. 6, '76</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Governor</span>,&mdash;I have been very unwell all day,
caused by the nervous exhaustion of yesterday's work in the
House. And yet I will try to give you some idea of the
situation and the results. The banking and currency committee
decided to report the repeal of the resumption<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
date on Friday. I persuaded them to wait till Saturday,
hoping that your letter would come and change the situation.
The letter did come, but the committee were perfectly fixed
in their determination to report. I tried to get them to substitute
a commission to inquire and report in December on
the whole resumption question. They offered to accept this
as an amendment, but not as a substitute. To this the hard-money
New England men would not agree, and so I decided
to offer my substitute, as we could well vote for repeal pure
and simple, without measures of preparation. We had a
debate of two hours. You will find what I said in the
<cite>Record</cite>. After the debate was over they declined to let my
substitute be offered. The House was determined to get a
vote on it, and so no quorum voted on the motion for the
previous question. This brought them to terms, and they
allowed the substitute to be offered. It was lost by twelve
majority. If the House had been full it would have carried.
The vote then recurred on the repeal, and it was carried
by 20 majority, all the hard-money men voting against
it. There was no hard feeling, and no bitterness remains.
The hard-money men have made their record, and the soft-money
men have got the repeal, and no longer any excuse
for not carrying their States. I think that the matter is in
the best possible shape. The party is committed to specie
payments by the platform and your admirable letter, and
by Hendricks' mushy acquiescence.</p>

<p>"Immediately afterwards we passed a concurrent resolution
establishing a commission to consider the silver question
and the resumption of specie payments. So that we can
say that we have made provision for investigation and the
elaboration of a practical scheme for resumption.</p>

<p>"On the whole, I now think that the matter has been
managed as well as the difficulties of the situation would
admit.</p>

<p>"Your letter gives general satisfaction, especially to the
Southern members, who [are] loud in its praise.</p>

<p>"I hope that Congress will adjourn this week, so that we
may organize for the campaign. I have in preparation all
the necessary documents to show the frauds and corruption
of the administration, and if we have means to circulate
them I anticipate the best results.</p>

<p>Considering the friendly and very intimate relations
which had subsisted between Mr. Bryant and Mr. Tilden
from the latter's early boyhood, it was natural that the Governor
should inspire the request contained in the following
letter from one of his nephews. The correspondence which
ensued, and its results, will be found in Bigelow's <cite>Life of
Tilden</cite>, Volume I., page 300. It is proper to repeat here that
Mr. Bryant, at the time he wrote his letter declining to be
named as one of the Tilden electors, was only a proprietor
of half of the <cite>Evening Post</cite> property, and his partner, Mr.
Henderson, feared the effect upon the prosperity of the
paper which would be likely to result from the appearance
of its editor in such conspicuous relations with the Democratic
party. Mr. Bryant, however, went so far as to give
instructions, which were pretty carefully observed, to permit
nothing personally hostile to Mr. Tilden to appear in
the columns of the <cite>Post</cite> during the canvass, and voted for
him at the election.</p>

<p>Besides the reasons here stated for Mr. Bryant's embarrassing
attitude towards Mr. Tilden, there were others communicated
to Mr. Tilden a few weeks later by Miss Julia
Bryant in the note succeeding Mr. Pelton's.</p>

and we must know that he will not decline if nominated.
Will you undertake to communicate with him at once? I
would suggest that you write him and send a messenger with
the letter to Cummington&mdash;or perhaps it would be better to
write Mr. Godwin, who is there, or was a few days ago. Of

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Roslyn</span>, <i>Sept. 30, '76</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Tilden</span>,&mdash;I am very, very sorry that you
and your friends and your enemies will not see the article
in regard to the slanders about your income tax which my
father wrote at Cummington last Saturday. He bestowed
much time upon it, read it to me, and pronounced it himself
'a good article,' and sent it on Monday to Mr. Sperry,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
with the injunction to publish it entire, whatever might have
appeared previously on the subject in the <cite>Evening Post</cite>.</p>

<p>"After our return here this week a letter came from Mr.
Sperry begging my father most earnestly <em>not</em> to publish the
article, as it would certainly be followed by abuse of Mr.
Henderson in the <cite>Times</cite>&mdash;abuse more virulent than ever
before&mdash;because in this article the <cite>Times</cite> was attacked, although
indirectly, and most <em>severely censured</em>. It was
<em>urged</em> that my father should not persist in publishing what
would cause such distress to Mr. Henderson, already so worn
by his troubles. On this score my father felt that he must
yield, but he did it most unwillingly and quite ungraciously.</p>

<p>"I am anxious, however, that you should know what has
passed; and should know, also, that my father, averse as he
is to such constant watchfulness, has had much to combat
in keeping attacks on you out of the papers, and has insisted
that you should not be treated in the <cite>Evening Post</cite> otherwise
than with respect. You may think that he has not
exerted himself in your behalf, as he might have done for
an old and esteemed friend, and one who has done him such
good service; but, truly, it has required no small effort on
his part to keep the paper as moderate as it is.</p>

<p>"He knows that I am writing this now.</p>

<h2>TILDEN TO MISS HUNT</h2>

"<span class="smcap">138 Eagle St., Albany</span>, <i>Aug. 8th, 1876</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Miss Hunt</span>,&mdash;I lately learned by chance that it
is to you that I am indebted for a copy of the new edition
of the works of Ed. Livingston on criminal jurisprudence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
No information as to the source of the presentation had ever
before reached me. I ought, perhaps, to have caused inquiry
to be made into that matter, but in the rush of things
amid which I have lived, did not. The work which has
fallen on me in my present career has been constantly outgrowing
my help and my own capacity for attention to the
secondary things; and I must confess in myself a tendency
to become more and more absorbed, with increasing intensity
and increasing persistence, in the parts of the work on which
its success depends as on the turning-points of battle&mdash;a
habit not favorable to secondary things, very unfavorable
to the human machine, but surprisingly serviceable to the
work which gets the benefit of it.</p>

<p>"I will now say what I would have contrived the opportunity
to say earlier, if I had ever known to whom it
should have been addressed.</p>

<p>"It is impossible to appreciate more highly than I do
the character, abilities, and services to his country and to
the world of Ed. Livingston. And then, I have always taken
a special interest in the man. Among my early recollections
is this of him: He used to come to Lebanon Springs, which
is on the edge of the beautiful valley in which I was born
and passed my youth. My father's acquaintance with him
was the occasion of my seeing him and retaining a recollection
of his form and features. His taste for antiquarian
researches led him to dig open some mounds in the neighborhood
and leaving on the rustic mind some impression of
eccentricity. My father had been more intimate with the
chancellor, and deprived from him a taste for Merino sheep,
and shared in his importations.</p>

<p>"I need not add with how much interest I read Mr.
Hunt's biography of Ed. Livingston, which is itself a delicious
portrayal of a most attractive character.</p>

<p>"I beg you to accept my thanks for the volumes you were
so kind as to send me, and believe me,</p>

<p>"My aunt, Mrs. Barton, in a spirit of filial piety, had

the object Mrs. Barton herself suddenly died. The duty
having consequently devolved on me of distributing the volumes,
I felt special satisfaction in offering you a copy of
them, who, as the Governor of the native State of Edward
Livingston, are so conspicuous for wisdom and devotion to the
cause of public reform.</p>

<p>"May I venture to add a few words, and to say that at
such a moment as this it is quite impossible not to feel the
deepest interest in the work which you tell me has proved
so absorbing to yourself. It is, indeed, your high fortune to
lead in the reform all over our country, and no one, watching
the drift of the national canvass in your favor, can fail
to be full of hope and belief in the future.</p>

<h2>TILDEN TO HON. JOHN BRAGG, MOBILE</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">138 Eagle Street, Albany</span>, <i>Aug. 11th, 1876</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Mrs. Van Buren has been so kind as
to send me your letter to her. I am glad to renew an acquaintance
which, although slight, has not wholly passed
from my recollection.</p>

<p>"You mention an inquiry of yours in 1872, whether I
had entirely abandoned public life. In the sense of official
life, I can scarcely be said ever to have any. Tho' I have
given almost half my life to public affairs, it has been as a
private citizen. In 1846 I went to the Assembly for a special
object, to help Mr. Wright in a crisis of his administration,
and retired. In 1872 I went again to the same body
to obtain the impeachment and removal of corrupt judges
who swayed the administration of justice in the metropolis,
and again retired. In 1846, and again in 1867, I served in
conventions to revise the State Constitution. That is all in
that long period.</p>

<p>"I never destined myself to a public career. I did not
come into my present trust until I found myself unable in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
any other way to have it on the side of reforms I had begun
three years before, and to which I had surrendered my professional
business, attention to my affairs, and my peace and
comfort. I had felt gloomily the decay of all my early
ideals of my country, and engaged in the effort to restore
them in the city and State in which I live, with no idea of
any result to myself except of sacrifice. The logic of events
has brought me into my present situation. I have been
tempted to do so much to satisfy the curiosity of an old
acquaintance, and, as I stop, I do not know but I have provoked
more than I have satisfied.</p>

<p>"At any rate, it is a real pleasure to refresh what remains
of a set of early associations. I think you were something
of a pet of Mr. Van Buren, as I was also. He would have
been interested in the course of present events; and puzzled
about me, for he told me, near the close of his life, when
he had observed me for thirty years, that I was the most
unambitious man he had ever known.</p>

<p>"I will send you a pamphlet which will give you some
idea of the events in this State to which I have alluded.</p>

<p>"With much esteem, I am very truly yours,</p>

<h2>SIDNEY WEBSTER TO TILDEN</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Newport</span>, <i>12 August, 1876</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Governor</span>,&mdash;Since reading your admirable letter
of acceptance I have begun two letters to you to say how
sincerely I congratulated you, but have destroyed both,
chiefly moved thereto by memories of my young days, when
I had occasion to know how pestered a candidate for the
Presidency is by letters from friends which have no business
importance, but which, nevertheless, either consume his
precious time by the reading or are turned over to the files.
This letter now begun <em>may</em> have a better fate!</p>

<p>"I cannot see how an acceptance-letter could have been
framed better adapted to the imperative needs of the situation.
Repeal of the law of 1875 was on the platform, and
you had to deal with it. 'Contraction' is a red rag to our
friends in the West and South, and that must be accepted.
And along the Atlantic coast are they who fancy their pecuniary
salvation depends on <em>instantly</em> lifting the greenback<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
to an equality with gold, and these could not be lost sight
of. And, finally, you had to keep in mind a <em>policy</em> which
you could 'work' when you enter the White House next
March.</p>

<p>"There was possibly a little peril in departing from the
traditional acceptance-letter of fine phrases and loyalty to
the platform; but you did wisely to incur that peril, for I
do think your letter has practically eliminated the financial
issue from the canvass&mdash;has prevented an alarming sectional
conflict and bad blood between debtors and creditors&mdash;and
will in the end convince all reasonable people you purpose
to 'resume' as rapidly as human power can. And besides
this (which may seem a contradiction), I believe you have
given a hint to those who are in pecuniary distress and sorrow,
and would like inflated business to lift them, as they
think, out of their misery, that they had better join hands
with the Democracy.</p>

<p>"My idea of the canvass is that the independent voters
will soon come to think there is little difference in the purposes
of you and Governor Hayes, and the only question is
which of you is likely to be most able to carry them out.
That, of course, leads to an inquiry into the personal qualities
of the two candidates and the temper of the party behind
each. On both of those inquiries you <em>ought</em> to win, and
you will (excepting in a contingency to which I will presently
refer) win. If the independent voters appreciated
your mental and moral fibre as I do, they would not doubt
as to the first; and as to the second, our party is new in
power, ambitious to establish a dynasty, and is extremely
amenable to reason and fair-dealing.</p>

<p>"I was a little sorry you said anything of a second term.
You cannot accomplish much if it is known you won't have
a second, and a good way to treat Hayes would be to suggest
that he resign at the end of two years (if elected), or
never be inaugurated.</p>

<p>"My forecast of the situation is that 'the machine' will
squelch the reformer (but of that we can judge better after
the Republican <em>State</em> nominations); that the financial issue
will drop to the rear; and the Republican managers will
endeavor to force on us the Southern question and obscure
the reform issue. I hope our friends will not dally with
the Southern question, but say (defiantly and offensively, if
need be) that they will give no moral sympathy or support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
to those who seek to deprive the negroes of any of their
political rights or embarrass the free exercise of them.
Rightly or wrongly, they are citizens, and we at the North
must look upon them as such. Under the recent decisions
of the Supreme Court (which are correct) the Federal
govt., certainly the President, can do little; but it does
seem to me that your moral influence, if judicially manifested
in a letter for publication (as it would be by you),
would do good in every respect.</p>

<p>"I have written, as you see&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">currente calmo</i>&mdash;and at
too great length, for all I wished to express was my appreciation
of the wisdom of your acceptance-letter, and my
belief in your triumphant victory.</p>

<p>"Although the Fenian sympathizers seem disposed to oppose
the nomination of Mr. A.,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> I think their opposition can

himself willing to waive any claims he may have for
the nomination in favor of our man, has now changed his
mind and wants it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span></p>
<p>"We fear he will cause such discord in the convention as
to prevent our offering the nomination to Mr. A. upon the

it should be made with reasonable unanimity.</p>

<p>"We can carry the convention for our candidate, but not,

<h2>CHARLES F. ADAMS TO BIGELOW</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Adams Building, 23 Court St., Boston</span>, <i>January 10, 1906</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Bigelow</span>,&mdash;I have to acknowledge the
receipt of your favor of yesterday, the 9th.</p>

<p>"The extract you make from the letter of F. O. Prince
is quite intelligible to me. I remember all the circumstances.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tilden was very anxious, indeed, that my father
should be the Democratic candidate for Governor of Massachusetts
in 1876. Mr. F. O. Prince was then chairman, I
think, of the Democratic committee; at any rate, he was influential.
Mr. Tilden, as you very well know, was never at
a loss when it came to handling men.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tilden worked through Mr. Prince to accomplish
his end. William A. Gaston, afterwards Governor, desired
the nomination. It is he who is referred to as a 'certain
candidate.' My father was wholly unwilling to accept the
nomination unless it came to him unsought, and with 'reasonable
unanimity.' The Irish were strongly opposed to
him. Their dislike, or rather personal antipathy, to him
dated far back&mdash;as far, indeed, as 1840, when the questions
relating to the burning of the Ursuline Convent at Charlestown
were before the General Court of Massachusetts, of
which my father was a member.</p>

<p>"Considerable pressure had to be brought to bear upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
Mr. Gaston, who finally consented to withdraw, and did,
although not with very good grace, nominate my father at
the convention. His nomination, of course, gave a certain
prestige to the ticket. As a popular candidate in that election
my father did not prove a success. A considerable Irish
element refused to vote for him.</p>

<p>"It is rather strange to reflect that all these events occurred
now thirty-one years ago&mdash;nearly the lifetime of a
generation; but it is the Irish opposition to which Mr.
Prince refers as the 'Fenian sympathizers.' They proved
quite irreconcilable. The whole thing is now ancient history.</p>

<h2>JOHN BIGELOW TO AN INQUIRER</h2>

<h3>(MR. TILDEN'S WAR RECORD)</h3>

<p class="sig">
<i>"Sept. 1876.</i>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have an abiding faith that a falsehood
never hurts any but those who propagate it. It is also
my conviction that no man can pay a much greater homage
to another than to deliberately misrepresent him. It is a
cowardly confession of weakness and of inferiority. With
this sort of homage no public man in this country, so far as
I know, has ever been so liberally favored as Mr. Tilden.
But two short years ago and there was no American of equal
political prominence who could to a greater extent be said
to receive the praises of his countrymen, without distinction
of party, nor one, perhaps, who had enjoyed fewer of the
advantages of adverse criticism. From the moment, however,
that he loomed above the horizon as a probable candidate
for the Presidency until now, the invention of his political
adversaries has been taxed to the utmost to feed whatever
appetite remained unsatisfied for calumny and scandal.</p>

<p>"Most of these inventions are so improbable and monstrous
that they perish in coming to the birth. As, however,
you seem to think the charge of disloyalty during the war
has been raised to the dignity of an exception by the recent
letter of Gen. Dix, which you enclose, I cheerfully comply
with your request to furnish what I trust you and those other
Republican friends in Maine, with whom it has been my
privilege in times past to co-operate, will regard as a satisfactory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
answer, not only to the insinuation of Gen. Dix,
but to any and every other charge or insinuation that has
been or may be made in impeachment of the loyalty or patriotic
devotion of Mr. Tilden to the Union, whether before,
during, or since the war of the rebellion. To make this
perfectly clear I may be obliged to ask your patience, but
I will try not to abuse it.</p>

<p>"Let me first dispose of the statement of Gen. Dix that
'Mr. Tilden did not unite in the call for the great Union
meeting in New York, after the attack and surrender of
Fort Sumter; but he refused to attend it, though urgently
solicited to by one of his own political friends.'</p>

<p>"The most charitable construction to be put upon this
statement is that the writer had been misinformed; he certainly
could have had no personal knowledge upon the subject.
It was publicly contradicted when it first appeared
in print; it is not true in point of fact; and, if it had been,
it would not follow, by any means, that Mr. Tilden did not
sympathize in the objects of the meeting.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tilden received a formal written invitation, bearing
date the 18th of April, inviting him to act as an officer
of the meeting in question. As soon as he found himself
at liberty he went to the proper quarter to ascertain what
resolutions were to be proposed, and, on being satisfied in
regard to them, then and there assented to the use of his
name as one of the officers of the meeting. He not only
assented to such use of his name, but was himself in actual
attendance upon the meeting; and not only did he attend
this meeting, but only two days later he attended another
meeting of the New York bar, which was called for a similar
purpose, and took part in its deliberations.</p>

<p>"Now let me state to you precisely the attitude which
Mr. Tilden occupied during the war, and why he manifested
so much caution in any action which might possibly influence
the course of events at that critical moment.</p>

<p>"It has been my privilege to know Mr. Tilden familiarly,
not to say intimately, during his entire public life, embracing
a period of nearly or quite forty years. During that
time, though we frequently differed about processes, and
were often enlisted under opposing political organizations,
and though we took widely different views of the fittest way
to meet the storm which had been brewing since the repeal
of the Missouri Compromise, it never occurred to me for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
one moment to suppose there was any man in the country
less tolerant than he of the doctrine of secession, or prepared
to make greater sacrifices to preserve our Union and the republican
institutions which had been bequeathed to us.</p>

<p>"At the comparatively youthful age of eighteen years
Mr. Tilden had acquired settled opinions upon and shared
in the public discussions of the subject of secession. In a
speech at a Union meeting, held in Union Square, at which
Gen. Dix presided, and Hamilton Fish, William H. Aspinwall,
James Brown, Andrew Carrigan, and many other Republicans
were vice-presidents, on the 17th of September,
1866, Mr. Tilden, in vindication of President Johnson, incidentally
alluded to his early investigation of the subject
of secession, and to the conclusion to which he then arrived.
He said:</p>

<p>"'The Constitution of the United States is, by its own
terms, declared to be perpetual. The government created
by it acts within the sphere of its powers directly upon each
individual citizen. No State is authorized, in any contingency,
to suspend or obstruct that action, or to exempt any
citizen from the obligation to obedience. Any pretended
act of nullification or secession whereby such effect is anticipated
to be produced is absolutely void. The offence of
the individual citizen, violating the lawful authority of the
United States, is precisely the same as if no such pretended
authority ever existed.'</p>

<p>"On the subject of slavery, Mr. Tilden's opinions were
no less fixed. Though never what used to be known as an
Abolitionist, neither was he ever the advocate or apologist
of servile labor. In the controversy which grew out of our
territorial acquisitions from Mexico in 1847, he was for
doing everything to secure those Territories the benefit of
the social and industrial institutions of the North. In that
sense he acted in 1848 in opposing the extension of slavery
into any of the free Territories by the act of the Federal
government; and again, in 1854, when the repeal of the
Missouri Compromise was under consideration in Congress,
and the flames of sectional controversy broke out afresh,
Mr. Tilden was open and decided in his opposition to the
repeal, in reference to which he stated in a letter to Wm.
Kent in 1860:</p>

<p>"'I used all my influence, at whatever sacrifice of relations,
against the repeal ... because I thought a theoretical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
conformity to even a wise system dearly purchased by breaking
the tradition of ancient pacification on such a question
and between such parties.'</p>

<p>"Accustomed as I was to converse with Mr. Tilden freely
upon all public questions, even when our views were most at
variance, having always been in the habit of reading everything
which I knew to come from his pen, I feel that I may
safely challenge anybody to produce a particle of evidence,
either oral or in print, of any sympathy on his part either
with secession or with slavery, or any evidence that in the
course he felt it his duty to pursue he was not actuated by
his best judgment as to what was wise and right for the government
and for the welfare of his country. After the breach
with the South in 1854, I think I am competent to affirm that
he had no partisan relations whatever with slave-holding
States. In a letter to the <cite>Evening Post</cite>, written in February,
1863, he speaks of being taunted by Senator Preston King as
an object of proscription by the South, and of being asked if
he thought his name could pass the Senate of the United
States.</p>

<p>"'I answered,' said Mr. Tilden, 'that it was a matter of
very little consequence to me whether it could or not; but
that it was of great consequence to me that I should do what
I thought best for the country.'</p>

<p>"Every act and every expression of his during the war, so
far as it has come under my cognizance, was in full accordance
with this position, and, what is more, in entire
harmony with the whole tenor of his life.</p>

<p>"Better than any person that I knew, he comprehended the
irreconcilability of the forces that were arraying themselves
against each other in the country. Exaggerating, perhaps, the
danger of attempting to rule the country by a sectional party,
he deemed it the part of wise statesmanship to postpone as
long as possible, in the hope, through the mediatorial offices
of time and its inevitable changes, of avoiding a collision.</p>

<p>"No one contested the force of his reasoning on this subject;
but they derided his apprehensions of a civil war. So
preposterous did they appear to the impassioned multitude
in the North, that I remember myself to have been asked by
one of his personal friends whether he was quite in his right
mind on the subject.</p>

<p>"In 1860, after the failure of the Democratic party at
Charleston&mdash;though he was then and had been for several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
years withdrawn from political life&mdash;he did not hesitate
openly to proclaim his conviction that the dissolution of the
Democratic party and the attempt to govern the country
by a party like the Republican, having no affiliation in the
Southern States, would inevitably result in civil war. He
was asked to fill a vacancy in the delegation from New York
at the adjourned meeting of the Democratic convention of
that year in Baltimore. In that body he made two speeches,
in which he portrayed, as an inevitable consequence of a
sectional division of the Democratic party, a corresponding
division of the States and an armed conflict. These
speeches were described by those who heard them as inspired
by a solemn sense of patriotic duty and a most vivid perception
of impending dangers. After the election of Mr. Lincoln,
and when the dangers he had foretold were becoming
realities, he took part in several conferences in which Hamilton
Fish, the late Charles H. Marshall, the late Daniel
Lord, Moses H. Grinnell, the late Wm. B. Astor, Moses
Taylor, William B. Duncan, Richard M. Blatchford, A. A.
Low, and other gentlemen of more or less prominence participated;
and on two of these occasions he made speeches
in which he sought to impress upon his hearers a juster sense
than was generally entertained of the threatened dangers,
and of the fittest means of averting them.</p>

<p>"Earnestly as Mr. Tilden labored to avert the war and
to thwart the measures which seemed to him calculated to
precipitate it; anxious as he had been to contribute no fresh
ingredient of hatred to the seething caldron; when, without
any responsibility on his part, the war came, he never for a
moment hesitated as to the course he was to pursue. He
felt it to be the duty of every citizen to sustain the government
in its resistance to territorial dismemberment. To
those who thought, as did many then calling themselves Republicans,
that on the whole it would be as well to consent
to a peaceful separation, Mr. Tilden always answered that
peaceful separation was an illusion; that the questions in
controversy would be rendered infinitely more difficult by
separation, and new ones still more difficult would be created;
that, if the antagonized parties could not agree upon
peace within the Union, they certainly would not have peace
without the Union. They never could agree upon terms of
separation, nor could they agree upon the relations to subsist
between them after the separation; and, however lamentable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
might be the consequences, force could be the only
arbiter of their differences.</p>

<p>"Though Mr. Tilden was opposed to any illusory concessions
to the spirit of disunion; though he was satisfied, after
the attack on Fort Sumter, that the differences between the
two sections could only be settled by the last argument of
kings; and though he was disposed to do everything in his
power to make that argument as effective and decisive as
possible&mdash;his co-operation with the administration of President
Lincoln was qualified by a fixed difference of opinion
upon several points.</p>

<p>"This opinion was in accord with the view Mr. Tilden
had frequently expressed on other occasions, and was also
in accord with the opinion which he subsequently gave when
his advice was solicited by the then Secretary of War. The
week preceding and the week following Mr. Stanton's assuming
the duties of Secretary of War, and at his invitation,
Mr. Tilden had frequent conferences with him, at the
first of which he is reported to me to have said in substance:
'You have no right to expect a great military genius to
come to your assistance. The whole human race have been
able to furnish such men only once in a century or two;
you can only count on the average military talent; you have
three times the available population and perhaps nine times
the industrial resources of your antagonist; though you occupy
the exterior line, you have an immense advantage in
the superior capacity of your railways to move men and
supplies. What you have to do is to make your advantages
available; you must make your combinations so as to concentrate
your forces and organize ample reserves to be ready
to precipitate them on critical points. In the probable absence
of military genius you must rely on overwhelming
numbers, wisely concentrated.' Mr. Stanton appeared to
adopt these views, but unhappily they did not prevail in the
councils of the government.</p>

<p>"A year and a half later, when Mr. Tilden, accompanied
by ex-Gov. Morgan, visited Washington for the purpose of
securing greater harmony of action between the Federal and
State government, Mr. Stanton, in a conversation with Mr.
Tilden, referred to this advice, and added: 'I beg you to remember
I always agreed with you.' I refer the more freely
to the deference which Mr. Stanton testified to Mr. Tilden's
judgment in these matters, because it is known not only to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
the Hon. Peter H. Watson, then Assistant Secretary of War,
but to some, at least, of the members of Mr. Lincoln's Cabinet
who are now living.</p>

<p>"On the subject of the finances, an element so vital to
the successful prosecution of a war, Mr. Tilden's views were
at variance with those adopted by the administration; he
had more faith in the people, in their readiness to bear the
burdens and make the sacrifices which the occasion required,
than was manifested by the authorities at Washington. Before
their financial policy was fully determined upon he
advised that the money for carrying on the war should be
chiefly drawn from loans to be supplemented by taxes, and
no more Treasury notes not bearing interest issued than
were barely necessary to supply the new uses created by the
government in its own payments. He was of the opinion
that if these measures were promptly adopted, so that the
supply should keep pace with the wants of the government,
the war might be carried on without any serious embarrassment,
without any exorbitant inflation of prices, and without
any extreme depreciation of the government bonds. In
discussing the financial situation of our own State in his
first message to the Legislature in 1875, Gov. Tilden briefly
restated the views which he then entertained and expressed
upon this subject.</p>

<p>"Though Mr. Tilden foresaw the disastrous consequences
of the policy which prevailed at Washington, the wild inflation
of prices, the ruinous depreciation of government
securities, the extravagant premium on gold, and the certainty
that the continuation of that policy would lead, as
it has done, to incalculable disaster; and believing, as he
did, that it might even endanger the ability of the government
to continue the war, he rigorously abstained from any
public discussion of them that might tend to create the discredit
which he apprehended, and restricted himself to private
remonstrances with the more influential friends of the
administration.</p>

<p>"While doing all he could to counteract what he deemed
the errors of the government, both in the management of the
war and of the finances, he was determined neither to be
made responsible for nor to be compromised by either. His
attitude throughout that pregnant period of our history was,
so far as possible for a private citizen holding no official
or even active relations with any political party, that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
patriotic constitutional opposition to supposed errors of administrative
policy, openly co-operating with all the measures
of the government of which he approved, and privately
discouraging those of which he disapproved.</p>

<p>"At the same time he said, in a speech:</p>

<p>"'That in a time of war we could not deal with our government,
although disapproving of its policy, without more
reserve than was necessary in debating an administrative
question during a period of peace; that the reason was that,
if we should paralyze the arm of our own government, we
yet could not stay the arm of the public enemy striking at
us through it; that it was this peculiarity which had sometimes
caused minorities to be suppressed in the presence of
public danger, and made such periods perilous to civil
liberty.'</p>

<p>"Mr. Tilden was more solicitous than almost any other
prominent man in the country to avert the war, because he
saw more clearly than most men the grave proportions it
was likely to assume; and when it broke out he did not associate
himself publicly with the party which he had thought
had unwisely precipitated it, because he could not entirely
approve of the methods by which they were conducting it.
I have yet to see one particle of authentic evidence that,
when the war had become inevitable, Mr. Tilden did not do
everything that might have been reasonably expected of him
to make all the resources of the country available for its
vigorous and successful prosecution. Happily my own convictions
on this point are confirmed by abundant testimony,
some of which it may be a satisfaction to your friends that
I recapitulate:</p>

<p>"On the occasion of presenting a stand of colors to the
Thirty-seventh Regiment of New York State Volunteers on
the 22d of June, 1861, Mr. Tilden was among the speakers,
'and,' says John T. Agnew, who was also present and took
part in the ceremony, 'made a stirring appeal to the officers
and men of the regiment; a speech not excelled in patriotism
by any public speaker during the war of the rebellion.'</p>

<p>"At even an earlier period Mr. Tilden made a journey
to Washington, at the request of Brig.-Gen. Ewing, in the
especial interest of the Seventy-ninth Regiment of Highlanders.</p>

<p>"The Hon. J. D. Caton, formerly Chief-Justice of the
State of Illinois, and the bosom friend of President Lincoln,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
in a recent letter to the Hon. Mr. Hewitt, which has already
been published, says that during the war of the rebellion
he had several interviews with Gov. Tilden on the subject
of the war, and ever found him ardent and earnest in its
support.</p>

<p>"The Hon. Abram S. Hewitt, who, during the war, was
in constant intercourse with the War Department, and much
depended upon by its chief for his advice at the period, was
also in almost daily intercourse with Mr. Tilden. In a recent
speech in Congress, which has already become famous,
he indignantly repelled the idea that Mr. Tilden ever manifested
any sympathy with disunion.</p>

<p>"In October, 1862, Mr. Tilden prepared, in behalf of the
Democratic party, a declaration of its adhesion to the Union,
and of the war to preserve it. This declaration was made
in substance as written, and in so authentic and authoritative
a form as to produce a profound popular impression,
both in the South as well as in the North. I have examined
the manuscript, which has fortunately been preserved, and,
with a perfect familiarity with the Governor's handwriting,
have no difficulty in verifying its authenticity.</p>

<p>"In 1864, Mr. Tilden, though absorbed by his profession
and holding no relations with the public not shared by any
private citizen, found himself appointed a delegate to the
Democratic National Convention at Chicago. He deemed it
his duty to attend. In the delegation he made a speech, the
substance of which was briefly reported. The points of it
were:</p>

<p>"1. Opposition to any declaration in favor of an armistice.</p>

<p>"2. He insisted that the adjustment of the controversy
pending between the North and the South, on any other
basis than the restoration of the Union, was manifestly impossible.</p>

<p>"At this convention Mr. Tilden used all his influence
to resist, though ineffectually, the adoption of certain expressions
in the platform that might have a tendency to
discourage the further prosecution of the war; he always
refused to acquiesce in them, and subsequently sent
a message to Gen. McClellan, the nominee of the convention,
urging him to disregard them in his letter of acceptance.</p>

<p>"To these evidences of Mr. Tilden's earnestness in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
prosecution of the war, let me add one more, which is perhaps
more conclusive than all the rest.</p>

<p>"All the members of Mr. Lincoln's Cabinet were perfectly
cognizant of his position during the war, and were
in the habit of soliciting his advice; and two of the three
who still survive, and with whom Mr. Lincoln had the most
intimate and durable relations, are now publicly advocating
his election to the Presidency.</p>

<p>"I wish you to realize, as I do, how utterly wanton and
shameless is this attempt to associate Mr. Tilden's name
with the enemies of his government, and how desperate must
be any cause which has to rely upon such methods for
success.</p>

<p>"As it seemed to be my duty as a journalist to oppose
and often to criticise the course pursued by Mr. Tilden,
both before and during the war, I feel it but simple justice
to him to bear this testimony to the honorable and patriotic
motives with which I never doubted him to be animated.</p>

take any further steps about. But I learn, on my return
from the North, from Mr. Manning and others, that the
project is assuming definite shape and may, unless at once
ended, be carried to a nomination.</p>

<p>"I appreciate how high the office is, and of what importance
and conspicuousness, and am sensible how much it is
beyond anything to which I could at present naturally aspire.
I feel gratified that I should have been thought of
at all in connection with so great a trust, and am especially
proud that you should have deemed me fit successor.</p>

<p>"The more I reflect, however, the more convinced I am
that <em>it will not do</em>.</p>

<p>"I feel certain that under the present circumstances my
nomination would be a mistake, and <em>know</em> that it might be
fatal.</p>

<p>"Aside from these public considerations, I have private
reasons which you would admit sufficient, if I could trouble
you with them, to prevent my acceptance of the nomination.
I should deeply regret it if these, in fact, interfered with
the success of our party, but I am sure such is not the case.
I regard them as insuperable, and I have written Mr. Manning
a note, of which he can make public use, declining to
have my name used at the convention.</p>

<p>"I write this that you may first and at the earliest moment
know of my conclusion.</p>

</p>

<p>"The recent publications in the newspapers of the capture
of William M. Tweed, at Vigo, in Spain, are confirmed

<p>"There are several indictments for forgery, found by the
Grand Jury of this county, against said Tweed, which were
untried at the time of his escape on the 4th day of December
last.</p>

<p>"He was also at that time in my custody, under an order
of arrest, issued in a suit commenced against him by the
people of the State of New York, in which a judgment has
since been perfected in an amount over $6,000,000, the execution
on which has been returned wholly unsatisfied.</p>

<p>"It is said that the government of Spain are willing to
surrender said Tweed to the authorities of this county.</p>

<p>"May I ask you to present the subject to the government
of the United States, so that prompt and efficient measures
may be taken to secure his surrender?</p>

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;As a Southern man, whose interest in
your election is greater than your own, because it involves
the right to live, I beg permission to make a single suggestion,
the result of general intercourse here for the last ten
days with gentlemen from all sections of the country. The
politicians, as a rule, are not overzealous for your success.
Could they separate their fate from yours this feeling would
be openly manifested. Your self-poise offends their vanity,
and they are controlled where they think they should direct.
It was the confidence of the people in this phase of your
character, as much, even, as the spirit of reform, that secured
you the nomination at St. Louis. It certainly greatly
influenced my action. Still, I think, if you will allow me to
say it, it might be proper for you to recognize and act upon
certain suggestions that have been made with reference to
the campaign in Indiana. Your election may not depend
upon the result in that State in October, but it will be so
urged and considered generally, and I am very sure that
you have not overlooked this possibility. The suggestion
I wish to make is that you would in some proper way manifest
such interest in that election as to satisfy your friends
in that State and elsewhere that you appreciate the importance
of carrying that State in October. My excuse for
this letter is the fact, known to you, that I was an original
Tilden man, and, I will add, I have seen no reason to
regret it.</p>

<p>"I shall leave to-day for Alabama, carrying with me the
conviction that your election is almost an assured fact. God
grant it. With high respect, yours very truly,</p>

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Bigelow</span>,&mdash;The attacks on the personal character
of Mr. Tilden are shameful. There was no need of asking
me to see that a fair and just treatment of his statement
in refutation of the story about the income tax should
be accorded to him in the <cite>Evening Post</cite>. I wrote to Mr.
Sperry yesterday on the subject, telling him that I thought
that the paper should express as great indignation at the
slander, as soon as its refutation should be made public, as
if the Republican candidate had been the subject of it. I
only wish that the opportunity for such an expression had
been given a little earlier.</p>

<h2>CHARLES O'CONOR TO TILDEN</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <i>Sept. 22d, 1876</i>.</p>
<p>
"To his Excellency <span class="smcap">Samuel J. Tilden</span>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<i>Governor of the State of New York</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;It is probable that William M. Tweed, a noted
delinquent, who went abroad many months since, will be tendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
to the custody of the Sheriff of the City and County
of New York within a few days.</p>

<p>"At the time of his departure the same sheriff held him
in formal custody under an order of arrest in a civil action
requiring bail in $3,000,000. Since his departure judgment
has been recovered against him in that action at the
suit of the State to an amount exceeding $6,000,000.</p>

<p>"For his negligence in permitting the escape there was,
in fact, no ordinary civil remedy against the sheriff except
a very trivial and inadequate one on his official bond. The
proper steps for securing this measure of redress have been
pursued with all proper diligence; and, until this time, there
did not seem to be any utility in prosecuting any other line
of action. But as Tweed may be again in custody at an
early period, it has now become important to consider what
course should be adopted for the purpose of rendering that
custody safe and secure. As already stated, the remedies
allowed by law against the delinquent custodian who allows
his prisoner to escape are totally inadequate. Consequently,
should Tweed be again in legal custody, there will be no
effective security for his detention to meet the awards of
civil and criminal justice, except what may be afforded by
the personal and official fidelity and vigilance of the custodian.</p>

<p>"Your predecessor, Governor John A. Dix, made a public
and official remonstrance against the palpable favoritism
displayed towards this person in his then existing custody
as a prisoner in the Penitentiary. During the same year
the Sheriff of the City and County of New York, by gross
negligence, suffered the escape of Genet, a convict of the
same general class as Tweed.</p>

<p>"With these circumstances to excite vigilance, the present
sheriff nevertheless allowed Tweed to enjoy a sort of free
custody, precisely similar to that which had been accorded
to Genet; and Tweed, availing himself of the facility, left
the State.</p>

<p>"Would it be proper, on Tweed's return, to place him in
charge of the same officer? I think you will answer this
question in the negative.</p>

<p>"The Constitution, arts. 10, secs. 1 and 5, together with
the act of 1848, Edmonds Statutes, vol. 3, p. 330, affords
to you as Chief Executive the means of meeting the exigency.
You can, on brief notice to him, remove the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
sheriff and appoint a perfectly reliable custodian to receive
the prisoner.</p>

<p>"Perhaps all the office I ought to assume in this matter
properly ends here. But, when one acts at all in an important
affair, he ought to do all that his best judgment dictates
towards accomplishing the object in view.</p>

<p>"The history of Tweed's prosecutions, imprisonments,
judicial releases, and ultimate deliverance from custody is
well known to you and the public. To it I refer for a justification
of my further remarks.</p>

<p>"The person whom you may appoint to fill the place
made vacant by a removal of the present sheriff can hold
only until the end of the present year. A new sheriff,
elected by the people, with full notice of their needs in
November next, will enter on his duties on the 1st of January,
1877. For the short term of about three months created
by the removal, I take leave to recommend the appointment
of General Francis C. Barlow. His persistent hostility
to official swindlers, and his zealous activity in prosecuting
Tweed to conviction, are well known to you. Tweed would
not escape from his hands. I have consulted no one on this
subject, nor have I any knowledge that General Barlow
would accept the office. Should he do so, you will have well
performed your duty; and, in any event, your tender of the
appointment will effectually refute all assertions that you
owe Tweed favor, or fear his disclosures.</p>

<h2>WM. M. TWEED PLACED AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE NEW YORK
AUTHORITIES</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Department of State, Washington</span>, <i>Oct. 10, 1876</i>.</p>
<p>
"To his Excellency <span class="smcap">Samuel J. Tilden</span>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<i>Governor of the State of New York</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Referring to the letter which your Excellency
addressed to me from the city of New York on the 19th
Septr. last, with reference to the case of William M. Tweed,
at that time understood to be held in custody by the Spanish
government, and to the acknowledgment of that letter by the
Acting Secretary of State on the 21st ultimo, I have the
honor to state that in the month of July last there were
received in this department duly authenticated copies of two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
indictments, found in the Court of General Sessions for the
city and county of New York, against William M. Tweed
and others for forgery and other offences.</p>

<p>"In the month of June last a person believed to be
Tweed, but passing under the name of John Secor, had clandestinely
landed on the island of Cuba, and the authorities
of that island, with the sanctions of the Spanish government
at Madrid, purposed to deliver him to the United States,
but he escaped from the island on or about the 27th day of
July, and sailed for a port in Spain.</p>

<p>"The Captain-General of Cuba despatched a steamer in
pursuit, which failed to intercept his flight, and on his arrival
at Vigo he was immediately arrested and placed in confinement.</p>

<p>"Instead of returning him to Cuba, the Spanish government
decided to deliver him directly to the United States,
and placed him on board the U. S. steamer <i>Franklin</i>, which
left the port of Vigo on or about the 28th day of September
with Tweed, <em>alias</em> Secor, on board, under orders to sail
for the port of New York, where she may be expected to
arrive some time from the 20th to the last of this month.
After the news of the arrest in Spain became known, the
sheriff of the city and county of New York also addressed
me a letter, stating that he had process against Tweed, requiring
the custody of his person in the county of New
York, from which he escaped in December last, and requesting
such action on the part of the government as will secure
his return to answer the behest of the process in his hands,
and offering to bear all the necessary expenses of conveying
him to New York.</p>

<p>"The uncertainty at that time attending a surrender by
the Spanish government prevented any definite reply to the
sheriff, or any more positive answer on the subject than that
which was addressed to you on the 21st September.</p>

<p>"But now, as the person referred to has been actually
delivered by the Spanish government to the government of
the United States, and as no doubt seems to exist that this
person, calling himself Secor, is William M. Tweed, the
President, in pursuance of the intention with which he decided
to receive him, deems it proper to place him at the
disposal of the authority of the State of New York, and instructs
me for that purpose to inform your Excellency, as
Governor of the State, that on the arrival of the <i>Franklin</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
orders will be given to the naval officers for the delivery of
Tweed into the custody of the sheriff of the city and county
of New York, such being the disposition theretofore requested
by you in your letter.</p>

<p>"Inasmuch as such orders must necessarily pass through
the proper channels of the Navy Department and should be
explicit, and in New York awaiting the arrival of the
steamer, to be executed immediately upon such arrival, I
venture to request the earliest possible expression of any
particulars or details which you may desire carried out to
insure the proper transfer of the custody of this person into
the hands of the authorities of New York, so that the instructions
may be in the proper hands by the 20th of this
month; and I venture to suggest that it may greatly tend to
facilitate the matter if no public information be given as to
the details of the matter.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have reason to know that your opponents

hard times, and the use of money. The word 'reform' is
not popular with working-men. To them it means less
money spent and less work. Most of these men are Catholics.
You will see that the Republicans have dropped the school
question. I think it important that some quiet, judicious
person should visit the large towns and see the leading Irishmen
and call their minds back to the hostility of Hayes and
the Republicans to their nationality and religion. There is

You are aware that Z. Chandler and Tyner were

some of the doubtful States in the North and N. West, including

<h2>JUST WHAT CHANDLER DID, AND HOW THE PLAN WAS LAID
TO DEFEAT THE POPULAR CHOICE FOR PRESIDENT</h2>

<h3>[<i>From the New York</i> <cite>"Times"</cite> <i>of June 15, 1887.</i>]</h3>

<p>"The New York <cite>Sun</cite>, after three days of hard labor, has
finally produced a curious reply to the <cite>Times's</cite> comments
upon Mr. William E. Chandler's connection with the election
of 1876. The best answer to its series of misrepresentations
will be found in the following statement of what did
actually occur at the Fifth Avenue Hotel on the morning of
Nov. 8 of that year.</p>

<p>"As stated on Saturday last in the <cite>Times</cite>, a gentleman
entered the Fifth Avenue Hotel at the Twenty-third Street
door about 6.30 o'clock in the morning, possibly a little before
that hour. He went at once to the rooms of the national
committee and found them occupied only by a number of
servants in the hotel, who were engaged in cleaning and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
setting the rooms to rights. He was informed that everybody
had gone home or to bed a couple of hours before.
He left the room and started for the clerk's desk to ascertain
the number of Mr. Zachariah Chandler's room. While
opening the first door in the direction of the reading-room,
on his way to the office of the hotel, he came in collision with
a small man, wearing an immense pair of goggles, his hat
drawn down over his ears, a great-coat with a heavy military
coat, and carrying a grip-sack and a newspaper in his hand.
The newspaper was the New York <cite>Tribune</cite>. The gentleman
did not recognize the stranger, but the stranger recognized
the gentleman immediately. The stranger cried out:
'Why, Mr. Blank, is that you?' The gentleman knew the
voice, and said: 'Is that you, Mr. Chandler?' He answered:
'Yes, I have just arrived from New Hampshire
by train. D&mdash;n the men who brought this disaster upon
the Republican party.' The gentleman replied: 'The Republican
party has sustained no disaster. If you will only
keep your heads up here, there is no question of the election
of President Hayes. He has been fairly and honestly
elected.'</p>

<p>"Chandler replied: 'Look at this paper.' The answer
was that the paper had not the news, and the gentleman
began to give Mr. Chandler an idea of the situation, when
Chandler interrupted him, saying: 'I have just got the
key to my room; come up-stairs.' Upon entering the room,
Mr. Chandler placed his grip-sack in the corner, took off his
overcoat, sat down in a chair&mdash;the gentleman taking the
only other one in the room&mdash;and Chandler said: 'Now go
ahead.' The visitor went over the ground carefully, State
by State, from Maine to Oregon, counting the electoral vote
in each State, and showing the vote as it was finally counted
for Hayes and Tilden. After he had finished, William E.
Chandler said: 'Well, what do you think should be done?'
The gentleman replied:</p>

<p>"'Telegraph immediately to leading Republicans, men
in authority, in South Carolina, Florida, Louisiana, California,
Oregon, and Nevada.' Mr. Chandler made no direct
reply to this proposition, but said:</p>

<p>"'We must go and see Zach.'</p>

<p>"The gentleman said:</p>

<p>"'Do you know the number of his room?' William E.
Chandler replied:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Yes, I know where it is.' To which the gentleman
answered:</p>

<p>"'If you don't know exactly, I'd better go to the office and
get the number; I was going there when I met you.' Chandler
said: 'No, I know where it is,' and led the way around
to the Twenty-fourth Street side of the hotel. After proceeding
a short distance down the corridor he looked up at
the number over a door and said: 'This is Chandler's
room.' Then he began to knock and kick at the door. The
noise at once awakened the inmate, and there proceeded
from the room a series of shrill screams and shrieks, followed
by an affrightened female voice crying out: 'What
do you want? Go away; I'm a lone woman.' Chandler
immediately darted down the corridor. The gentleman said:
"See here, if you don't know the number of the room we'd
better go immediately down to the office and get it; we don't
want anything more of this kind." Chandler insisted that
he would be right the next time, however, and walking still
further down the corridor he selected a room about four
doors below the first one he had attacked. The response to
his knock was immediate and not uncertain. There was no
scream in this case, but the inmate shouted in angry tones:
'Get out; I'm a lady. Why do you disturb me at this
hour. Go right away, or I will call the servants.' Chandler
then remarked: 'I guess I'll have to go down to the
office.' Whereupon he darted down-stairs, ascertained the
number of Zachariah Chandler's room, which was between
those of the two ladies whom he had thus unceremoniously
aroused, and he began kicking and knocking at the door,
of the right room in this case, and did so for a little time
without effect. The gentleman then joined with him in
thumping and kicking the door, remarking: 'We'll wake
up the whole house and will have the police down on us if
we don't look out,' when in a moment came the well-recognized
voice from the inside, 'Who's there?' to which
William E. Chandler replied: 'It's me, Chandler; open
the door, quick.' The door was shortly opened, and Mr.
Zachariah Chandler was discovered standing in his nightdress.
Mr. William E. Chandler then said, closing the door:
"Here is a gentleman who has more news than you have,
and he has some suggestions to make.' To which Zach
Chandler replied: 'Yes, I know him. What is it?' With
this he seated himself on the edge of his bed. William E.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
Chandler then said: 'The gentleman will tell you the story
himself. He understands the case better than I do.'</p>

<p>"The gentleman then went over the details of the election,
and added the recommendations he had made to William E.
Chandler.</p>

<p>"The chairman of the national committee laid down and
said: 'Very well, go ahead and do what you think necessary.'
The two visitors left the room and went to the
telegraph office in the hotel. It was just five minutes before
seven by the hotel clock when they arrived there. The telegraph
office was not open, and they were informed that it
would not be open until 8, possibly later. The two men
stood by the receiver's shelf at the little telegraph inclosure,
Chandler with his back to the door opening towards Twenty-third
Street entrance. The other gentleman faced Chandler,
leaning on the shelf, with his back to the door leading
into the great hall of the hotel. The only other persons in
the room were a few servants and a clerk in the newsstand.
The gentleman said: 'I'll have to take these messages to
the main office of the Western Union.' Chandler called a
servant and directed him to have a carriage brought to the
Twenty-third Street entrance. Then Chandler said: 'Well,
what do you want to do?'  The gentleman replied: 'We'll
first telegraph to Gov. Chamberlain, of South Carolina.' The
gentleman dictated the despatch, which appeared in the <cite>Sun</cite>,
and which was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
"'<i>To D. H. Chamberlain, Columbia, S. C.</i>:
</p>

<p>"'Hayes is elected if we have carried South Carolina,
Florida, and Louisiana. Can you hold your State? Answer
immediately.'</p></blockquote>

<p>"Mr. Chandler took the despatch in shorthand, as dictated.
The gentleman then proposed to send a similar despatch to
S. B. Conover, of Florida. Mr. William E. Chandler immediately
objected, saying that Conover was as much of a
Democrat as he was a Republican, and would probably show
the despatch to the Democrats as early as he would to any
Republican in town. At any rate, the Democrats would get
it first. The gentleman remarked:</p>

<p>"'Have you any other proposition to make, or have you
any one in your mind whom it would be safer or better to
address?' Mr. William E. Chandler scratched his ear with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
his pencil, and after a moment's consideration said he had
not. The gentleman then said it was imperative that some
one should be woke up down there, and if Mr. Chandler
could think of no one else it was essential to telegraph to
Conover. Mr. Chandler hesitated for an instant, and said:
'Well, I suppose we must; something has to be done.' The
gentleman accordingly dictated to Chandler the Conover despatch.
Here it is:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>

"'<i>To S. B. Conover, Tallahassee, Fla.</i>:<br />
</p>

<p>"'The Presidential election depends on the vote of Florida,
and the Democrats will try and wrest it from us. Watch
it and hasten returns. Answer immediately.'</p></blockquote>

<p>"The gentleman then suggested S. B. Packard as the
proper person to address in Louisiana, and the Packard
despatch was dictated to, and taken down by, William E.
Chandler in shorthand:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>

"'<i>To S. B. Packard, New Orleans, La.</i>:<br />
</p>

<p>"'The Presidential election depends on the vote of Louisiana.
The Democrats will try to wrest it from you. Watch
it and hasten returns. Answer immediately.'</p></blockquote>

<p>"The gentleman then asked: 'To whom shall we send in
Oregon?' Mr. Chandler said: 'John H. Mitchell.' The
Oregon despatch was then dictated:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>

"'<i>To John H. Mitchell, Portland, Oregon</i>:<br />
</p>

<p>"'Without Oregon Hayes defeated. Don't be defrauded.
Hasten returns. Answer.'</p></blockquote>

<p>"The gentleman suggested that George C. Gorham, of San
Francisco, was the proper man to receive a telegram. Chandler
at once assented. Then the gentleman suggested that
probably he might be able to do something with Nevada and
Oregon, and a despatch something as follows was prepared:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>

"'<i>To George C. Gorham, San Francisco, Cal.</i>:<br />
</p>

<p>"'The Presidential election depends on our having both
Nevada and Oregon, which are reported for Hayes. Telegraph
both those States immediately. Watch them and
hurry results. Answer immediately.</p>

<p class="sig">
"'<span class="smcap">W. E. Chandler</span>,<br />
"'<i>Fifth Avenue Hotel</i>.'
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span></p>

<p>"Chandler says, in his testimony before the Potter committee,
that he found the Gorham despatch among some
papers. This happened in this way: After the despatch had
been written some verbal changes in it were suggested. Mr.
Chandler found some trouble in making them on the telegraph
blank, and the gentleman who dictated the despatch
remarked: 'You'd better write that despatch over again;
you'll save time.' Chandler did so, and the original despatch
got into his pocket with the rest of his papers.</p>

<p>"William E. Chandler signed with his own name the despatches
to Oregon and to Gorham, of San Francisco. To
the despatches sent to Conover, Packard, and Chamberlain
the narrator's recollection is he signed the name of Zachariah
Chandler. William E. Chandler at once took telegraph
blanks and wrote from his stenographic notes the five despatches
above printed, the gentleman standing by him
taking every despatch as he finished it and carefully reading
it. When the last despatch was transcribed, Chandler
handed it over to the gentleman and said: 'Are they all
right?' He was informed that they were. Chandler immediately
started to open the door from the reading-room to
the Twenty-third Street entrance that the gentleman might
make a hasty exit, but Chandler made a bungling job of it;
finally the two reached the outer door. The gentleman
jumped into the carriage there waiting and told the driver
to get to the main office of the Western Union with all possible
speed. Probably the quickest time ever made by a
carriage from the Fifth Avenue Hotel to the Western Union
was made that morning. Arriving at the Western Union
office the gentleman went to the receiver's desk and handed
in the despatches. The receiver, who knew the gentleman
very well, said: 'Good-morning.' The gentleman said:
'Get these despatches off as quickly as possible, and charge
the Republican National Committee.' The receiver replied:
'The National Committee has no account here, and
we can't do it. Why not charge them to the New York
<cite>Times</cite> account?' The gentleman replied, 'All right,' and
the receiver immediately handed them back to him to be
countersigned. This was promptly done, the gentleman returned
to his carriage and was driven back to the Fifth
Avenue Hotel. There was still nobody stirring connected
with the National Committee.</p>

<p>"And now a few extracts, which the <cite>Sun</cite> failed to discover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
in the Potter committee's report, are pertinent. First, in
regard to the telegram to George C. Gorham, in San Francisco,
Mr. Chandler testified:</p>

<p>"'I found among those papers this copy of a telegram
which I sent from the Fifth Avenue Hotel. I think before
daylight on the morning of Nov. 8. It bears date of the
7th of November, but it was really written and sent on the
morning of the 8th.'</p>

<p>"Immediately after this comes the following sentence, bear
in mind, from William E. Chandler's testimony before the
Potter committee:</p>

<p>"'The remaining copies are in shorthand, and I will read
them.'</p>

<p>"If these messages were not dictated to Mr. William E.
Chandler, why should he have written them in shorthand?
When time was so precious, is it to be believed that William
E. Chandler wrote his own messages first in shorthand and
then transcribed them? Further down on the same page
(526) of the testimony occurs the following:</p>

<p>"'This paper [handing to the chairman a paper from
which he had read] is worn from carrying it in the pocket.'</p>

<p>"The chairman: 'Who made these stenographic marks?'</p>

<p>"The witness: 'Those are my own. I learned to write
shorthand many years ago.'</p>

<p>"It is perfectly clear from this (Chandler's own testimony)
that these messages were dictated to Chandler by
another person. They were so dictated exactly as described
in the foregoing narrative. The New York <cite>Times</cite> has never
to this day been reimbursed by the National Committee or
William E. Chandler, nor has William E. Chandler or any
national committee ever offered to pay the <cite>Times</cite> for the
telegraph tolls or for any of the expenses incurred on that
morning.</p>

<p>"Mr. Chandler's efforts in behalf of the grand old Republican
party on the morning of Nov. 8, 1876, may therefore
be briefly summarized as follows:</p>

<p>"First.&mdash;He frightened two lone women nearly out of
their wits.</p>

<p>"Second.&mdash;He finally discovered the number of Zachariah
Chandler's room.</p>

<p>"Third.&mdash;He acted as an amanuensis for a gentleman who
dictated five despatches. (Work well done.)</p>

<p>"Fourth.&mdash;He asked a servant to bring a carriage around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
to the Twenty-third Street entrance of the Fifth Avenue
Hotel. (Result satisfactory.)</p>

<p>"Fifth.&mdash;He attempted to open a door to enable the gentleman
bearing the despatches the more readily to reach the
street. (Made a mess of it.)</p>

<p>"Mr. Zachariah Chandler, chairman of the National Committee,
asked the gentleman above alluded to, on the evening
of Nov. 8, if it would not be well to send William E. Chandler
to Florida. The gentleman thought it would. Mr.
William E. Chandler left for Florida on the following day
at 6 <small>P.M.</small> Mr. William E. Chandler, therefore, did not
initiate the idea of going to Florida. The truth is that
Zachariah Chandler wished to send to Florida a gentleman
who had been formerly a private secretary to William H.
Seward, but the person was not at hand and could not be
reached in time. William E. Chandler for this important
mission was a second choice.</p>

<p>"The whole scheme of sending what were afterwards called
'visiting statesmen' to the doubtful States originated in
the brain of Zachariah Chandler, not William E. Chandler.</p>

<p>"If the New York <cite>Sun</cite> and Mr. William E. Chandler can
find any comfort in the foregoing plain narration of facts
they are entirely welcome to it."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Notwithstanding Mr. Tilden's popular majority, the public
needs not now be told that he was counted out by the
instrumentality of an extemporized tribunal, not only unknown
to the Constitution, but in distinct disregard and
violation of the provisions of that instrument for counting
the electoral votes for Presidents and Vice-Presidents. A
detailed account of the processes by which this great national
crime was initiated will be found in the first chapter of the
second volume of Bigelow's <cite>Life of Tilden</cite>. To that record,
however, some important testimony has since been disclosed
which appears to have escaped the biographer's notice.</p>

<p>At a meeting held at Chickering Hall on the evening of
November 12, 1891, to sympathize with Governor Nichols's
war on the Louisiana lottery system, the late Abram S.
Hewitt was one of the speakers. In the course of his remarks
in denunciation of the lottery gambling in Louisiana,
Mr. Hewitt said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't find words strong enough to express my feelings
regarding this brazen fraud.</p>

<p>"This scheme of plunder develops a weak spot in the
government of the United States, which I would not mention
were it not for the importance of the issue. We all know
that a single State frequently determines the result of a
Presidential election. <em>The State of Louisiana has determined
the result of a Presidential election. The vote of
that State was offered to me for money</em>, and I declined to
buy it. <em>But the vote of that State was sold for money!</em>"</p>

<p>A day or two after this anti-lottery meeting the New
York <cite>Sun</cite> recites this passage of Mr. Hewitt's speech, and
accompanies it with the following pertinent and instructive
comment:</p>

<p>"We do not remember that this highly important testimony
has ever before been elicited from Mr. Hewitt in any
public declaration. He says that he has personal knowledge
that the vote of Louisiana was sold to Mr. Hayes' managers
for money; that the same vote was offered for money to
him as Mr. Tilden's representative, and that he declined to
buy it&mdash;very properly, as all patriotic citizens and all
honest men will agree.</p>

<p>"Some time in the summer of 1878, when the great crime
was less than two years old and the beneficiaries of that
crime were still in the full enjoyment of its fruits, there
occurred a spirited, we may even say a bitterly personal,
controversy between the Hon. Henry Watterson and Mr.
Hewitt as to the extent of the latter's responsibility for the
failure of the Democratic party to obtain its rights by the
seating of Mr. Tilden in the office to which he had been
elected. Col. Watterson acrimoniously, and, as we are glad
to believe, unjustly, charged Mr. Hewitt not only with a
mismanagement of Democratic interests at the time of the
electoral count, but also with suppressing the fact of Mr.
Tilden's personal disapproval of the electoral commission
bill at a critical time in the deliberations of Mr. Tilden's
friends at Washington.</p>

<p>"The merits of the Watterson-Hewitt controversy are not
now of living interest. Time doubtless has softened the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
sentiments of each of the two statesmen with reference to
the other's part in the events of 1876 and 1877. We refer
to the incident merely to say that even under the strongest
provocation to disclose all that he knew about the theft of
the Presidency, Mr. Hewitt withheld the statement which
he made so distinctly and emphatically at an anti-lottery
meeting in Chickering Hall fifteen years after the crime.</p>

<p>"There was also, as it may be remembered, a searching
investigation into all of the circumstances surrounding the
theft of the vote of Louisiana, conducted by the special committee
of the Forty-fifth Congress, known as the Potter committee.
The object was not to remedy the irremediable, but
to bring out the whole truth, to fix the responsibility where
it belonged, and to make a repetition of the crime forever
impossible. Those Democrats who possessed special knowledge
bearing upon the crime came forward and testified.
The report and testimony of the Potter investigation fill
about twenty-five hundred printed pages, but on no page
is there any piece of evidence more important than that
which Mr. Hewitt volunteered on Thursday night before a
mass-meeting called for an enterprise of moral and social,
rather than political, reform.</p>

<p>"We speak of the Potter investigation merely to say that
the Hon. Abram S. Hewitt was not among the witnesses
before that committee. He did not appear to testify to the
sensational facts which he gave so freely to the anti-lottery
meeting in Chickering Hall. In all the twenty-five hundred
pages he appears only once, and then indirectly.  Major
Burke testified that when he went to Mr. Hewitt as the
ostensible manager of Mr. Tilden's case in the House, and
asked him whether Louisiana was to be abandoned by the
Democratic managers, Mr. Hewitt replied, among other
things, that 'the Democratic party could not afford to take
the responsibility of plunging this country into anarchy and
strife, upsetting values and disturbing trade.'</p>

<p>"But Mr. Hewitt's silence on previous occasions, when
his testimony would have been so valuable, does not render
it less interesting, now that its importance is mainly historical."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span></p>

<p>In <cite>Harper's Magazine</cite> for the month of March, 1907, will
be found an article from the accomplished pen of Frederick
Trevor Hill, entitled "The Hayes-Tilden Contest&mdash;A Political
Arbitration," in which occurs the following statement
of an incident of the nefarious transaction under consideration,
which no one has ventured to contest, and which leaves
no longer a doubt that Mr. Tilden must have been declared
President instead of Mr. Hayes, despite all the other devices
by which he is believed to have been counted out, but for
the forgery of signatures to the returns from Louisiana which
escaped the attention of the perhaps too-eminent counsel in
charge of Mr. Tilden's case, a forgery for the concealment
of which Senator Ferry seems to be indirectly responsible:</p>

<p>"The proceedings opened as usual with the reception of
the conflicting certificates from the Senate chamber&mdash;five
documents in all&mdash;and while these important papers were
being perfunctorily examined and initialed by the presiding
justice, the journalists in the gallery watched the scene, the
lawyers whispered together and prepared for the coming
contests; the general public waited, bored and inattentive, and
some of the Republican managers sat quaking with fear.</p>

<p>"Judge Clifford finally laid aside his pen, and it was
ordered that the various exhibits which he had been marking
be printed and copies furnished for the convenience of the
counsel and commissioners. Had a single objection to this
routine been interposed; had prudence, habit, or even curiosity
impelled any of the Democratic counsel to scrutinize the
original documents, or had enterprise prompted any journalist
to examine and compare them, a sensational exposure
would have been inevitable, for one of the Republican certificates
was clumsily, even obviously, forged.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span></p>
<p>"Had this been discovered, it is not improbable that one
or more of the Republican commissioners, who were suspected
of wavering in their party allegiance, would have voted
for a thorough investigation, and an entirely different result
might have been effected. Neither suspicion nor inspiration,
however, put the Democratic champions on their
guard, and the opportunity passed unheeded, never to return."</p>


<h2>FRANCIS C. BARLOW<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> TO JOHN BIGELOW</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <i>Nov. 6, 1876</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I believe I have never thanked you for
the legislative documents, which I beg now to do.</p>

<p>"I did not overlook the last clause of your letter, in which
you express a hope that you may see me on the stump for
Tilden. I have been on the stump for Hayes, doing what I
can, and I have the strongest confidence that we are going
to elect him, and that because I believe there is too much
good sense in the American people to turn over this govt.
and its credit to those who 10 or 12 years ago were trying to
destroy it. I think this will carry us through.</p>

<p>"Neither Mr. Tilden nor any one else can stem the rebel
influence if he is elected.</p>

<p>"I have always said that I thought that Tilden, if elected
by the Republican party, would make an admirable President,
but with the rebels and copperheads and the Democratic
party, with all its villainies behind him, he will
ruin us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span></p>

<p>"On Wednesday you will be as sorry that you did not
advocate Hayes, as I shall be (win or lose) glad that I opposed
Tilden.</p>

<p class="sig">
Yours truly,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Francis C. Barlow</span>."
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the last paragraph of this letter the general got both
his boots on the wrong legs. When John Sherman, as the
Warwick of the Hayes dynasty, was sending all of the staff
officers of the Republican party into the South to see not if,
but that, Hayes was elected, General Barlow was one of the
number, and the only one, I regret to say, of that formidable
crowd who had the manliness to admit on their return
that the ballot had been tampered with, and that Hayes was
not honestly entitled to the electoral vote. The general, however,
unfortunately both for himself and the country, was
too strong a party man to publicly assail the corrupt scheme
devised by the conspirators to place in the Presidential chair
one who was not the choice of the nation.</p>

<p>I do not think that he was as glad that he had opposed
Tilden as I was and am that I did not advocate the election
of Mr. Hayes.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Assuming, as I do, that you are elected,
I greatly rejoice. I congratulate you, and I congratulate
the country. I have never felt so much solicitude as to any
political matter as in reference to the result of this election.
The welfare of the people and their govt. demanded a

of economy and honesty in the administration of the
Federal govt. Under you I am confident we will have the
greatly needed reforms.</p>

<p>"We did not do as well in this county as I expected and
believed we would. But our young men, especially, worked
hard and deserved success. But the Republicans made a
very great effort to and did hold their people pretty well;
and a good deal of money, wherever it came from, was used
in the county, and they, with this, got most of the purchasable
vote. I hope you are well. Take care of your health.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;May I venture, with great respect, to offer
a suggestion which, in this extraordinary crisis, might, it
seems to me, if you approve, have a good effect with the other
side.</p>

<p>"Would not a public expression of your well-considered
views <em>now</em>, in the present state of things, tend to exercise a
good influence? Your friends all remember how much good
was done, on a different occasion, by that admirable letter
to Mr. Hewitt, shortly before the election, about rebel
claims, etc.</p>

<p>"Might not the calm, patriotic, and therefore assuaging
utterances of your pen <em>now</em> tend to an early settlement upon
the basis of right and justice by bringing to bear, with accumulated
force, upon the bad men so conspicuous in the
disputed States, the just indignation and censure of honest
and influential men of their own party, who could not fail
to be influenced by such an expression from you, causing
those men, at least, to <em>pause</em> in their mad career?</p>

<p>"Might it not, at least, have the effect of <em>gaining time</em>,
and smoothing the way for the dispassionate and final and
possibly controlling judgment of the better elements of the
Republican party?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pray pardon the freedom of the suggestion. It is
doubtless not new to you or the friends about you, but this
may at least serve to show how the suggestion strikes another
mind at a distance.</p>

<p>"Suffer me to avail myself of the occasion to congratulate
the American people and yourself upon the unmistakable
majority of the Electoral College and immense popular
majority in your favor.</p>

<p>"<i>Confidential.</i></p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Memphis, Tenn.</span>, <i>Nov. 18th, 1876</i>.</p>

<p>"His Excellency <span class="smcap">Samuel J. Tilden</span>, etc.
</p>

<p>"Enough has developed itself since my former letter to
confirm the correctness of the views there expressed. I see
indications of a weakness in the <em>backbone</em> of the Republican
leaders, and if they stood without a controlling power over
them they would yield. But the President has his <em>own purposes
to accomplish</em>, and he will not let them yield.</p>

<p>"On and after the 5th of March next, if there be no President
or Vice-President elected and inaugurated, there is no
provision <em>in the Constitution</em> for the <em>further existence</em> of
any <em>government</em>. The Constitution, which is the chart of
the government, will have <em>expired</em>, leaving nothing but the
<em>physical skeleton</em> of the constitutional government. Grant
knows this and sees it, and will shape <em>everything</em> to <em>bring
about that end</em>. He will, by his measures, <em>defeat you and
Hayes</em> both by shaping the means to the end.</p>

<p>"The constitutional government, thus ended, with no
power or provision anywhere for its <em>reorganization</em>, Grant
finds himself in possession of a physical government, without
the restraints of a Constitution&mdash;with the army, navy,
and treasury at his command; he will be the <em>absolute ruler</em>
of a government of <em>force</em>, in which his <em>will</em> will be the law.
If Congress should prove <em>refractory</em> he will know how to
deal with that body. There are three notable historical
parallel cases for his guidance.</p>

<p>"His professions of a purpose to have a <em>fair count</em>, using
his <em>army</em> and <em>navy</em> to bring it about, is one of the means by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
which he will delude the people and <em>conceal</em> his <em>real purpose</em>.
His purpose will not be lost sight of, and he will hold to
the <em>Republican party</em> and its <em>confidence</em> until his <em>usurpation</em>
is <em>assured</em>.</p>

<p>"You are the only man who can save the government&mdash;<em>preserve</em>
the Constitution and the liberties of the people.
To accomplish these ends, you <em>must act</em>. In the end, <em>three-fourths</em>
of the American people will <em>sustain you</em>. The time
will soon pass when <em>action</em> will <em>accomplish anything</em> or will
be <em>possible</em>. <em>Time by action</em> may <em>possibly avert</em> the great
<em>national calamity</em>, but without <em>action</em> the case is hopeless.</p>

<p>"I do not expect you to answer my letters. I cannot
write more fully. I can only make <em>suggestions</em>. Let your
private secretary say my letters are received. If deemed
necessary I would visit you.</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Mount Vernon, Ohio</span>, <i>Nov. 18th, 1876</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Mr. President</span>,&mdash;For so I still believe you
to be. Your course during the late canvass inspired me with
great confidence in your judgment, and nothing but the momentous
issue now upon us could induce me to make suggestions
for your consideration.</p>

<p>"A party that drifts in a crisis like the present is certain
to wreck upon the breakers. And whatever policy is to be
adopted should be carefully considered, promptly be determined,
and be decisive. The inauguration of two Presidents
means a war which in its destructiveness would dwarf
the rebellion. Not to count the electoral vote and declare
an election would be to create a dictatorship which would
soon result in armed conflict. This is one side of the picture.</p>

<p>"If you are counted out by fraud, as is probable, would
acquiescence cause a repetition of the wrong four years
hence; or would it electrify the country and cause an outburst
of indignation against the wrong-doers?</p>

<p>"Again, is it certain that an armed conflict would not
disintegrate the Union? If they found the battle going
against them would not the pretended Republicans of the
North offer to recognize the independence of a Southern
confederacy?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span></p>

<p>"If two Presidents are inaugurated then comes the problem
of money and munitions. New York and other ports
would be put in blockade, and revenue be thus cut off.</p>

<p>"Men who do not dream of going into the conflict themselves
may glibly advise a recourse to arms.</p>

<p>"If your policy be one in the interest of peace, then a
patriotic address to your countrymen would give you a noble
immortality, preserve constitutional government, and restore
the Democracy to power at the next election. Should such
be your determination, meetings should be simultaneously
held throughout the Republic, declare your election, but
waive the administration of the government, and denounce
the usurpers who seek to overthrow the Constitution.</p>

<p>"In conclusion, I have but to say, if the facts show that
you are elected, for one I will stand by you, let the result
be what it may.</p>

<p>"With great respect for your ability and entire confidence
in your patriotism, I have the honor to subscribe myself,</p>

Senator Conkling, and I am happy to inform you he is
sound as a bullet all through. He says of course he is desirous
his party should succeed, but if it is expected he will
consent to succeed by fraud they are mistaken. He is sound

<p>"He is devoting himself to the law, and means to act with
our friends in the Senate.</p>

<p>"He asked me what position our people meant to assume,
and whether they meant to act upon the <em>good-boy principle</em>
of submission, or whether we mean to have it understood that
Tilden has been elected and by the Eternal he shall be inaugurated?
Thinks the latter course advisable; the submission
policy he don't much believe in.</p>

<h2>AUGUST BELMONT TO TILDEN</h2>

<p>
"<i>Private.</i></p>

<p class="sig">"<i>Thursday</i> (<i>Nov. 23, 1876</i>).
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Governor</span>,&mdash;I had a long talk with Curtis,
and have made it all right. He <em>volunteered</em> the information
that he wrote the <cite>Sun's</cite> article yesterday, but without entering
into the discussion of the merits of his argument I
told him that all our friends viewed the question differently.</p>

<p>"<em>He will keep quiet</em>, I know, and I hope Barlow has been
equally successful with Dana. No pains ought to be spared
to get him all right so as to end, as far as he can, the mischief
of yesterday's article.</p>

<p>"Curtis is anxious for your success, but he is a <em>vain</em> man,
who likes to be made something of. I think some little notice
of him by you or your friends in the way of asking his
legal advice or other co-operation would secure him completely
to your interests and silence his constitutional croaking.</p>

<p class="sig">
Yours sincerely,<br />
"<span class="smcap">August Belmont</span>."
</p>

<p>The editorial of the <cite>Sun</cite> here referred to, after giving in
detail the provisions of the Constitution for the counting
of the electoral votes for President and Vice-President, proceeds
to give the advice which so disturbed Messrs. Belmont
and Barlow:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"We<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> now proceed to state what, in our opinion, the Constitution
means by counting the votes. It is to be noted
that the Constitution commits the choice of a President and
Vice-President, in the first instance, to a body of electors
who are to be chosen in each State as its legislators may
direct. These electors are to meet, to vote, and to make and
sign and seal up a certificate of their votes. These instruments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
denominated in the Constitution 'the certificates,'
are to be transmitted to the President of the Senate 'sealed.'
They are, in our opinion, not merely <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</i>, but they
are conclusive, evidence that the Electoral Colleges of the
States from which they come gave the votes which they
purport to certify.</p>

<p>"We can conceive of no reason why the Constitution required
the electors to make and sign and certify lists of the
votes which they gave, excepting that it was required in
order to give legal verity to the contents of the certificates.
For the same reason we hold that to 'count the votes' so
certified does not import or imply a power to inquire into
the legality, sufficiency, or regularity of the appointment of
the electors whose appointment is duly certified by the State
authorities whose duty it is to give to the two Houses of
Congress legal information of that appointment. It will
never do, in our judgment, to draw analogies for the government
of this matter from the practice of legislative bodies
in judging of the rights of their members to seats. That
practice rests upon an express constitutional provision; and
it is from that express power to determine the legality of an
election that their whole authority to go behind the certificate
of a sitting member is derived.</p>

<p>"But these Electoral Colleges are peculiar bodies, whose
appointment is committed wholly to the States, whose certificates,
when their official character has been duly vouched
by their States, become by force of the Constitution the sole
and exclusive legal evidence that the votes of those States
have been cast for such and such persons as President and
Vice-President. It cannot be, therefore, that any authority
can reside anywhere to try any question, or to find any fact,
that is to warrant the two Houses in rejecting the votes of
any Electoral College of whose authority to give those votes
the State, through its constituted authorities, has legally
informed Congress. All such questions and all such facts
belong to the proper authorities of each State to try and
determine before the persons supposed to be chosen electors
are assembled to give their votes. Any attempt by the two
Houses, or either of them, to go behind the certificates and
to determine the right of the electors to give the votes which
they have certified, when the State has determined that right
by its competent authorities, will lead to conclusions in which
the people of this country will not acquiesce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thus, if it shall be found on an inspection of the certificates
of the Electoral Colleges, when they are opened in
the presence of the two Houses, that Mr. Hayes has received
185 votes, or more, that result must be accepted by the people
as the legal result, whatever may have been the frauds
committed in Louisiana or any other State in taking or returning
or counting the popular vote. It is perfectly proper
for Congress to ascertain the fact of such frauds in an authoritative
and conclusive manner for the information of
the people, but the certainty that there are such frauds cannot
affect the legally certified election. Mr. Hayes must be
inaugurated and acknowledged as President, even if the
legal result is so tainted with fraud that honest men revolt
at the very thought they must submit to. There is no alternative
but civil war; and that forms an unnecessary and inadequate
remedy, and is not to be thought of. If Hayes
shall be declared President, with grave reason to believe that
he has not been honestly and fairly entitled to have the electoral
votes of certain States, he and his party must bear the
consequences. Those consequences, if his opponents are
wise, will be, not that his title to the office is to be resisted,
but that the people are to be appealed to to use their constitutional
and peaceful methods of redressing all wrongs
and punishing all outrages&mdash;namely, by the ballot-box.
No such appeal can be made if the country is to be plunged
into anarchy by denying Hayes' title to the office. Our
government must be preserved and perpetuated; and that it
may be, grievous as the wrong will be that takes from Tilden
States in which he has certainly carried a majority of the
popular vote, we must submit to that wrong, in the entire
certainty that the party responsible for it will in due time
be rewarded with political annihilation.</p>

<p>"We shall therefore deprecate and oppose any action by
the House of Representatives looking to any dispute of the
regular electoral certificates from any of the States. The
responsibility for what is done in the three controverted
States is with the Republicans, and there let it rest. All
that the House of Representatives can properly do in the
premises is to ascertain and determine the precise nature,
methods, and extent of the frauds, and then leave the question
to the judgment of the country, and to the legal and
constitutional remedy afforded by the next elections."</p>

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear General</span>,&mdash;Now is a time, it seems to me, when
every true lover of our country will desire to do all he can
to allay excitement and to reach an honest and fair conclusion
upon the question about which all are thinking&mdash;Who
ought to be the next President? I believe a great majority
of the American people, North and South, desire peace and
quiet, as well as an honest decision on that question; but
there are, unfortunately, some in both sections, and perhaps
in Congress, who have nothing to lose and may gain something
by turmoil, strife, and excitement.</p>

<p>"When the pot boils much froth and scum rise to the
surface, which otherwise might never be known to exist.</p>

<p>"It appears to me the <em>crisis</em> will be upon us when the two
Houses of Congress meet to count or see counted the electoral
votes. Disputes must arise about many questions, by reason
of the complications now surrounding the situation.
Who shall decide between them? The great want is a
tribunal to whom may be referred at once, <em>without debate</em>
or excitement, all disputed points. This tribunal should not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
only be honest and impartial and able, but the Congress and
the people should <em>believe</em> so. Could not such a tribunal be
organized <em>before the dispute begins</em>? It might be extraconstitutional,
but its decrees could be made binding in this
particular case by consent of all concerned.</p>

<p>"Let Congress request Mr. Tilden to select the chief
judge in his State or in New Jersey or Virginia, and let
Mr. Hayes take the chief judge of Ohio or Pennsylvania or
Illinois or Massachusetts; let these two be joined by the
Chief Justice of the U. S. as a third member.</p>

<p>"The last named has never been a violent partisan, and
is specially acceptable to the bar in Richmond, Virginia,
and elsewhere in the South. Let this tribunal decide all disputed
points in accordance with the Constitution and precedents,
as far as applicable, by common law and common-sense.
Let their judgment be final and conclusive. By
such a course justice would be done and all parties satisfied.</p>

<p>"The Illinois electors here have agreed they will vote an
open ballot. If any elector refuses so to vote, or refuses to
throw a ballot for Hayes and Wheeler as he votes, they will
immediately declare a vacancy in the district thus represented
by such judge and elect another in his place; they
claim that such action is not only perfectly justifiable, but
that it cannot be reviewed by any tribunal, as the action of
the electors is final. If this meets with your approbation I
suggest you to telegraph this programme to every Republican
State.</p>

<p>The subscriber of the last preceding letter during the
Civil War was on the staff of General Grant, and when the
latter became President acted as his private secretary. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
was indicted in 1876 by the Grand Jury of St. Louis for
frauds upon the revenue and for the "safe-burglary conspiracy"
referred to in the following testimony of one of
the witnesses in the trial, Col. H. C. Whitley, who was one
of the parties charged, but desired, before doing so, to place
on the record a conditional pardon granted him.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'Harrington took a letter from his pocket and asked me
if the signature was that of A. B. Cornell, and I said it was
not. He said that some of Pinkerton's detectives were here,
and I should send some of my men to work in with the
memorialists and find out what they were doing. I sent men
out. Harrington gave me some names on a paper whom he
wished to be worked in with. I don't remember the names.
I told Harrington that I would send men over, naming Mr.
Nettleship. I went to New York on the same night (15th)
and sent Mr. Nettleship over, giving him the names, and
telling him that they were the parties to be worked. I don't
remember that I gave Nettleship any instructions to report
to Harrington at this particular time. I was again in this
city on the 29th of March, having previously sent over a
man named Oberworth with Nettleship. I found on my
arrival that Oberworth had been arrested for peddling cigars
without a license, and I told Harrington that he (Oberworth)
was one of my men, and he was released. Mr. Harrington
complained that the men were good for nothing, and
he wanted men who would push matters along and work to
some purpose. Harrington said something must be done;
that he had a plan which would throw dirt and ridicule on
the memorialists. He said they thought that Evan's books
were in his office, and they were trying to get them, and he
thought that to have his office robbed was the best plan;
he said he did not care if his safe was knocked or blown to
hell, as the damned safe belonged to him. I said I did not
wish the men to get into trouble, and Harrington replied
that there was no danger, as he was district attorney, and
they should not be hurt. I came from New York on the
29th, and returned the same night. I came again on the
8th of April, and saw Gen. Babcock at his office. I asked
how matters were about the investigation, and he said all
right, that Harrington kept him posted up.</p>

<p>"'I was again in Washington on the 27th, arriving in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
afternoon, four days after the safe was blown up. I went
up to Harrington's house, and he told me about what had
transpired during the blowing of the safe. He said that
everything would have worked all right except for the interference
of Major Richard, the superintendent of police,
who would not co-operate with him. After that I called
upon Gen. Babcock at his office in the White House. He
spoke about the safe burglary, saying that it was very badly
managed; that he thought I was smarter than to allow things
to go on as they did. The next time I saw Babcock was in
New York, in the May following. I went up to the Fifth
Avenue Hotel in that city. After talking to him a while
I said that I expected that there would be some more trouble
about the case. Babcock said: "No; stand by your guns;
I'll protect your rear." I spoke to him about Bluford Wilson,
then the Solicitor of the Treasury, investigating my
office in New York for the purpose of ascertaining whether
any of the secret-service men were connected with the safe
burglary, and then told him I would do it, that is, stand by
my guns if he protected the rear.</p>

<p>"'Soon afterward I had an interview with Harrington at
the Metropolitan Hotel, New York. I complained to him
that the whole matter of the safe burglary seemed to be falling
upon the secret service, and that we would likely get
into trouble about it. Harrington said: "No; I am the real
district attorney at Washington, and I will protect all of
you." I told him that Somerville wanted some money, and
Harrington gave me $500 for him. I paid it all to Somerville
as part of his fee. Harrington did not say what particular
service Somerville rendered. During the same
month I had an interview with Babcock here. I called to
see him at his house. Harrington then lived a few doors
from him on the same row. I told Babcock I wanted to see
Harrington, and Babcock sent after him. Harrington came
in by the alley gate to Babcock's yard. I told Harrington
that Somerville wanted more money, but do not remember
that Babcock heard me speak to Harrington, or that he knew
the money was to go to Somerville. All I remember is that
Harrington brought me the money, and that I gave it to
Somerville, who said he wanted to use it to get Benton, the
burglar who was arrested on the night of the burglary, out.'</p>

<p>"In speaking of other interviews with Babcock, Whitley
testified as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span></p>

<p>"'In the autumn of 1875 I called at Babcock's cottage at
Long Branch and had a talk with him. I told him that
Albert Cunz and Delome, two former secret-service men, had
been thrown out of employment in consequence of the safe
burglary and their connection with it. Babcock said he
would try and get them in the New York Custom-House.
I told him that I would like for myself a commission to go
somewhere, and Babcock said he would see the Secretary of
the Treasury, and have me sent to Europe with some bonds.
I told him I did not want to go to Europe, but wanted to go
to Colorado. Babcock said: "If any trouble comes up you
can 'slide off,'" or words to that effect. I told him I had
had trouble enough in connection with the case, and did not
want any more.</p>

<p>"'I had a conversation with Harrington after we were
indicted in the fall of 1874 in the Metropolitan Hotel. I
told him I did not like the idea of being indicted in the matter.
He told me it would be all right, that he would pay
counsel for me. He directed me to write and employ Gen.
S. S. Henkin, of Washington, as my attorney, which I did.
That case resulted in a hung jury. This spring, previous
to going before Proctor Knott's committee, I called at the
White House to see Gen. Babcock, and requested him to do
all he could to have Mr. Rice, who was with me, appointed
postmaster at Pueblo, Colorado. He said he would assist
all he could. As I was leaving the room, I remarked to
him: "Things look like we will have more trouble." He
answered: "Yes, things do look squally; but it will all blow
over again."'"<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Babcock was acquitted, with the aid of a deposition by
General Grant, and only a few weeks before this trial was
promoted to a colonelcy.</p>

<p>Only four months before the indictment and trial of
Babcock, Secretary Belknap, a member of President Grant's
Cabinet, was impeached and put on trial before the Senate
at Washington. During the trial the late George F. Hoar,
one of the Republican Senators from Massachusetts, addressed
the Senate, and closed his discourse with the following
fearful arraignment of the administration during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
the Presidency of Grant, and gave a transparent exposure of
the reasons why the satellites of the President were determined
to shrink from no crime necessary to prevent the
inauguration at Washington of a President who had become
famous by the havoc he had already made of the Tweed
Ring plunderers in New York and the Canal Ring plunderers
at Albany, and whose advent to Washington would
put to flight the horde of miscreants who then infested both
ends of the capitol:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"My own public life has been a very brief and insignificant
one, extending little beyond the duration of a single
term of Senatorial office, but in that brief period I have seen
five judges of a high court of the United States driven from
office by threats of impeachment for corruption or maladministration.
I have heard the taunt from friendliest lips,
that when the United States presented herself in the East to
take part with the civilized world in generous competition
in the arts of life, the only product of her institutions in
which she surpassed all others beyond question was her corruption.
I have seen in the State in the Union foremost in
power and wealth four judges of her courts impeached for
corruption, and the political administration of her chief city
become a disgrace and a by-word throughout the world. I
have seen the chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs
in the House, now a distinguished member of this
court, rise in his place and demand the expulsion of four
of his associates for making sale of their official privilege
of selecting the youths to be educated at our great military
school. When the greatest railroad of the world, binding
together the continent and uniting the two great seas which
wash our shores, was finished, I have seen our national triumph
and exaltation turned to bitterness and shame by the
unanimous reports of three committees of Congress, two of
the House, and one here, that every step of that mighty enterprise
had been taken in fraud. I have heard in highest
places the shameless doctrine avowed by men grown old
in public office that the true way by which power should be
gained in the republic is to bribe the people with the offices
created for their service, and the true end for which it
should be used when gained is the promotion of selfish
ambition and the gratification of personal revenge. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
heard that suspicion haunts the footsteps of the trusted companions
of the President. These things have passed into
history. The Hallam, or the Tacitus, or the Sismondi, or
the Macaulay who writes the annals of our time will record
them with his inexorable pen; and now, when a high Cabinet
officer, the constitutional adviser of the Executive, flees
from office before charges of corruption, shall the historian
add that the Senate treated the demand of the people for
its judgment of condemnation as a farce, and laid down its
high functions before the sophistries and jeers of the criminal
lawyer? Shall he speculate about the petty political
calculations as to the effect of one party or the other which
induced his judges to connive at the escape of the great
public criminal; or, on the other hand, shall he close the
chapter by narrating how these things were detected, reformed,
and punished by constitutional processes which the
wisdom of our fathers devised for us, and the virtue and
purity of the people found their vindication in the justice
of the Senate?"</p></blockquote>


<h2>CHARLES MASON TO TILDEN</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">'Alto,' near Edge Hill</span>,<br />
"<span class="smcap">King George, Va.</span>, <i>Dec. 5, '76</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Although I am confident if any one in
the U. S. has the ability to cope with the rogues who are
bent on cheating the people out of the hard-earned victory
they have achieved, in the Presidential contest, it is yourself;
yet, at the risk of being thought highly presumptuous,
I venture on a few suggestions I have not observed thrown
out by any one.</p>

<p>"That the Constitution does not provide for the extraordinary
condition of things in which we are placed by the Congress,
nor that any of its annotators furnish an apt construction,
is certain; and for the same reason, I suppose, as that
given by Bishop Warburton, why no allusion was made in the
Pentateuch to a future state. The patriots of the Revolution,
like the Patriarchs after the creation, no doubt thought the
proposition so self-evident and the provisions so ample for
pious and honest men that they did not dream of the world's
being peopled by such a race of sinners and corruptionists.</p>

<p>"If precedent is to be weighed in counting the votes, let
the spirit of the first example be wholly and rigidly observed.
There is doubt, in the first election of Gl. Washington,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
the president of the Senate did perform that ministerial
duty. But the order of the Senate, prepared by a
committee, and signed by John Langdon, the prest. 'elected
for that purpose,' expressly says 'the underwritten, appointed
president of the Senate for the sole purpose of receiving,
opening, and counting the votes of electors, did, in
the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives,'
etc., leaving it to be inferred (and no other conclusion will
hold water) that in doing this his functions ceased. Subsequently,
as you know, there were some variations from this
practice, but all going to the mere ministerial agency of that
officer.</p>

<p>"The bald attempt of McDonald, present chief clerk of
the Senate, to cite a different practice, in the case of Harrison,
when James W. Watson was president of the Senate,
by construing his action in his (McDonald's) own language,
as to imply judicial authority, does great violence to the
truth of history and the greatest injustice to that astute and
cautious statesman, who struggled all his life against the exercise
of doubtful powers and was never known to practise
one. This little incident on the part of McDonald is only
a part of the well-laid scheme to revolutionize the government
by seizure in the count of either of the returning
boards in the subjugated States, should be conscience-stricken
and obey the mandates of the Decalogue, rather
than the tyrant's order, and cast the electoral vote for you,
to whom all justly belong.</p>

<p>"Going through the pageant of a public inauguration is
by no means called for, as you are well aware; and I would
suggest that instead of allowing Sunday to intervene, that
Grant's term expires at 12 o'c. at night on the 3d of March,
when his power as Commander-in-Chief will cease, and
when Sherman will not dare use the army for their hellish
purposes. I make this suggestion for the reason that there
is a tradition in the family of Mr. Jefferson, to whom I am
nearly allied by marriage, handed down by himself, that
being informed commissions were to be made out by Mr.
Adams for judges and other officers after midnight, he
(Jefferson) entered the office of Secretary of State precisely
at 12 o'c. on the 3d of Mar. and demanded it of the Secretary,
John Marshall, I think, who, after some remonstrance,
yielded and delivered the keys to Mr. Jefferson. Allusion is
made to those midnight appointments in his correspondence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
but no mention is made of those particular circumstances.
I had them from Col. L. G. Randolph, his grandson, confidential
friend, executor and sole custodian of his papers
until sold to Congress.</p>

<p>"Some persons apprehend that if the election devolves
upon the House (which I cannot conceive possible on any
reasonable grounds) we shall lose the Vice-President, whose
choice will have to be decided by the Senate; but this cannot
be, as the contingency will not arise for such a resort.
For the Constitution expressly provides that 'the person
having the greatest number of electors shall be President,
if such number be the whole number of electors <em>appointed</em>.'
Now, how can they be appointed unless lawfully done, and
who is to judge of such legality? Certainly the House, or
it may be both Houses. So if the electoral vote of a State
be rejected by either, because of fraud, it is a nullity&mdash;no
vote at all&mdash;and therefore not <em>appointed</em>, and cannot be
estimated in the count, leaving you with 84, an undisputed
majority of the electors actually <em>appointed</em>. For, mark!
The Constitution does not require a majority of the whole
Electoral College, but of those <em>appointed</em>.</p>

<p>"If there should be any discussion about the authority
of the 'great seal of a State,' you are aware that it has been
nowhere so fully ventilated as in the famous New Jersey
contest for Congressional seats, when, if my memory serves
me, the Govr's. certificate was only respected when there was
no suspicion of fraud.</p>

<p>"I am, with great respect &amp; haste,</p>

<h2>GENERAL WINFIELD SCOTT HANCOCK TO GENERAL SHERMAN</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Carondelet P. O.</span>,<br />

"<span class="smcap">St. Louis Co., Mo.</span>, <i>December 28th, 1876</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear General</span>,&mdash;Your favor of the 4th inst. reached
me in New York on the 5th, the day before I left for the
West. I intended to reply to it before leaving, but cares
incident to departure interfered. Then, again, since my
arrival here, I have been so occupied with personal affairs
of a business nature that I have deferred writing from day
to day until this moment, and now I find myself in debt to
you for another letter in acknowledgment of your favor of
the 17th, received a few days since.</p>

<p>"I have concluded to leave here on the 29th (to-morrow),
p.m., so that I may be expected in New York on the
31st inst. It has been cold and dreary since my arrival
here. I have worked 'like a Turk' (I presume that means
hard work) in the country, in making fences, cutting down
trees, repairing buildings, etc., etc., and am at least able
to say that St. Louis is the coldest place in the winter, as
it is the hottest in summer, of any that I have encountered
in a temperate zone. I have known St. Louis in December
to have genial weather throughout the month; this December
has been frigid, and the river has been frozen more
solid than I have even known it.</p>

<p>"When I heard the rumor that I was ordered to the
Pacific coast I thought it probably true, considering the past
discussion on that subject. The <em>possibilities</em> seemed to me
to point that way. Had it been true I should, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
have presented no complaint, nor made resistance of any
kind.  I would have gone quietly if not prepared to go
promptly. I certainly would have been relieved from the
responsibilities and anxieties concerning Presidential matters
which may fall to those near the throne or in authority
within the next four months, as well as from other incidents
or matters which I could not control, and the action concerning
which I might not approve. I was not exactly prepared
to go to the Pacific, however, and I therefore felt relieved
when I received your note informing me that there
was no truth in the rumors.</p>

<p>"Then, I did not wish to appear to be escaping from responsibilities
and possible dangers which may cluster around
military commanders in the East, especially in the critical
period fast approaching. 'All's well that ends well.' The
whole matter of the Presidency seems to me to be simple and
to admit of a peaceful solution. The machinery for such a
contingency as threatens to present itself has been all carefully
prepared. It only requires lubrication, owing to disuse.
The army should have nothing to do with the selection
or inauguration of Presidents. The people elect the President.
The Congress declares in a joint session who he is;
we of the army have only to obey his mandates, and are
protected in so doing only so far as they may be lawful.
Our commissions express that! I like Jefferson's way of
inauguration. It suits our system. He rode alone on horseback
to the capitol (I fear it was the 'old capitol'), tied
his horse to a rail-fence, entered, and was duly sworn; then
rode to the Executive Mansion, and took possession. He
inaugurated himself simply by taking the oath of office.
There is no other legal inauguration in our system. The
people or politicians may institute parades in honor of the
event, and public officials may add to the pageant by assembling
troops and banners; but all that only comes properly
after the inauguration, not before, and it is not a part of it.
Our system does not provide that one President should inaugurate
another. There might be danger in that, and it
was studiously left out of the Charter. But you are placed
in an exceptionally important position in connection with
coming events. The capitol is in my jurisdiction also, but
I am a subordinate, and not on the spot, and if I were, so
also would be my superior in authority, for there is the
station of the General-in-Chief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span></p>

<p>"On the principle that a regularly elected President's
term of office expires with the 3rd of March (of which I
have not the slightest doubt), and which the laws bearing
on the subject uniformly recognize, and in consideration of
the possibility that the lawfully elected President may not
appear until the 5th of March, a great deal of responsibility
may necessarily fall upon you. You hold over! You will
have power and prestige to support you. The Secretary of
War is the mouthpiece of a President; you are not. If
neither candidate has a constitutional majority of the Electoral
College, or the Senate and House, on the occasion of
the count, do not unite in declaring some person legally
elected by the people, there is a lawful machinery already
provided to meet that contingency and decide the question
peacefully. It has not been recently used, no occasion presenting
itself, but our forefathers provided it.</p>

<p>"It has been exercised, and has been recognized and submitted
to as lawful, on every hand. That machinery would
probably elect Mr. Tilden President and Mr. Wheeler Vice-President.
That would be right enough, for the law provides
that in a failure to elect duly by the people, the House
shall immediately elect the President, and the Senate the
Vice-President. Some tribunal must decide whether the
people have duly elected a President. I presume, of course,
that it is in the joint affirmative action of the Senate and
House, or why are they present to witness the count if not
to see that it is fair and just? If a failure to agree arises
between the two bodies there can be no lawful affirmative
decision that the people have elected a President, and the
House must then proceed to act, not the Senate. The Senate
elects Vice-Presidents, not Presidents. Doubtless, in case
of a failure by the House to elect a President by the 4th of
March the President of the Senate (if there be one) would
be the legitimate person to exercise Presidential authority
for the time being, or until the appearance of a lawful
President, or for the time laid down in the Constitution.
Such course would be peaceful, and, I have a firm belief,
lawful.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt Governor Hayes would make an excellent
President. I have met him, know of him. For a brief
period he served under my command, but as the matter
stands I can't see any likelihood of his being duly declared
elected by the people unless the Senate and House come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
be in accord as to the fact; and the House would, of course,
not <em>otherwise</em> elect him. What the people want is a peaceful
determination of this matter, as fair a determination as
possible, and a lawful one. No other administration could
stand the test. The country, if not plunged into revolution,
would become poorer day by day, business would languish,
and our bonds would come home to find a depreciated
market.</p>

<p>"I was not in favor of the military action in South
Carolina recently, and if Genl. Ruger had telegraphed to
me or asked for advice, I would have advised him not under
any circumstances to allow himself or his troops to determine
who were the lawful members of a State Legislature.
I could not have given him better advice than to refer
him to the special message of the President in the case
of Louisiana some time before.</p>

<p>"But in South Carolina he had had the question settled
by a decision of the Supreme Court of the State&mdash;the highest
tribunal which had acted on the question&mdash;so that his
line of duty seemed even to be clearer than the action in the
Louisiana case. If the Federal court had interfered and
overruled the decision of the State court there might have
been a doubt certainly, but the Federal court only interfered
to complicate, not to decide or overrule.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, it is no business of the army to enter upon such
questions, and even if it might be so in any other event, if
the civil authority is supreme, as the Constitution declares
it to be, the South Carolina case was one in which the army
had a plain duty.</p>

<p>"Had General Ruger asked me for advice, and if I had
given it, I should, of course, have notified you of my action
immediately, so that it could have been promptly overruled
if it should have been deemed advisable by you or other
superior in authority. General Ruger did not ask for my advice,
and I inferred from that and other facts that he did
not desire it, or that, being in direct communication with
my military superiors at the seat of government, who were
nearer to him in time and distance than I was, he deemed
it unnecessary. As Genl. Ruger had the ultimate responsibility
of action, and had really the greater danger to confront
in the final action in the matter, I did not venture to
embarrass him by suggestions. He was a department commander
and the lawful head of the military administration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
within the limits of the department; but, besides, I knew
that he had been called to Washington for consultation before
taking command, and was probably aware of the views
of the administration as to civil affairs in his command. I
knew that he was in direct communication with my superiors
in authority in reference to the delicate subjects presented
for his consideration, or had ideas of his own which
he believed to be sufficiently in accord with the views of our
common superiors to enable him to act intelligently according
to his judgment and without suggestions from those not
on the spot, and not as fully acquainted with the facts as
himself. He desired, too, to be free to act, as he had the
eventual greater responsibility, and so the matter was governed
as between him and myself.</p>

<p>"As I have been writing thus freely to you, I may still
further unbosom myself by stating that I have not thought
it lawful or wise to use Federal troops in such matters as
have transpired east of the Mississippi within the last few
months, save so far as they may be brought into action under
the article of the Constitution which contemplated meeting
armed resistance or invasion of a State more powerful
than the State authorities can subdue by the ordinary processes,
and then only when requested by the Legislature, or,
if it could not be convened in season, by the Governor; and
when the President of the United States intervenes in that
manner it is a state of <em>war</em>, not peace.</p>

<p>"The army is laboring under disadvantages, and has been
used unlawfully at times, in the judgment of the people
(in mine, certainly), and we have lost a great deal of the
kindly feeling which the community at large once felt for
us. 'It is time to stop and unload.'</p>

<p>"Officers in command of troops often find it difficult to
act wisely and safely when superiors in authority have different
views of the law from theirs, and when legislation has
sanctioned action seemingly in conflict with the fundamental
law, and thus generally defer to the known judgment of
their superiors. Yet the superior officers of the army are
so regarded in such great crises, and are held to such responsibility,
especially those at or near the head of it, that
it is necessary on such momentous occasions to dare to determine
for themselves what is lawful and what is not lawful
under our system if the military authorities should be
invoked, as might possibly be the case, in such exceptional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
times when there existed such divergent views as to the correct
result. The army will suffer from its past action if it
has acted wrongfully. Our regular army has little hold
upon the affections of the people of to-day, and the superior
officers should certainly, as far as lies in their power, legally
and with righteous intent, act to defend the right&mdash;to
us&mdash;the <em>law</em> and the institutions we represent. It is a
well-meaning Constitution, and it would be well if it should
have an opportunity to be recognized as a bulwark in support
of the people and <em>the law</em>.
of the people and <em>the law</em>.</p>

<h2>HON. GEORGE HOADLEY TO THE "EVENING POST," JULY, 1901</h2>

<h3>(MRS. SPRAGUE AND THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION OF 1876)</h3>

<p>
"To the Editor of the 'Evening Post.'
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;My attention has been called to an article
which appeared in the <cite>Evening Post</cite> of Saturday, June 30,
giving an account of the various Democratic national conventions,
in the course of which there is, I think, a cruel
and untrue attack upon the memory of a lady who had hard
luck enough in this world, without being followed into her
grave, the late Mrs. Katherine Chase (Sprague). The
statement is directly made that a bolt from the decision of
the electoral tribunal which counted in Hayes in 1877 had
been organized by Mr. Conkling, but that he was deterred
from executing it by Mrs. Sprague's interference, based on
revenge for Mr. Tilden's opposition to her father's nomination
by the Democratic convention in 1868.</p>

<p>"I do not believe there is one word of truth in this story,
so far as it relates to Mrs. Sprague. It is perfectly true
that Mr. Conkling organized such a bolt, and that he secured
the adhesion of Senators enough to have reversed the decision
of the electoral tribunal in the matter of the Louisiana
electoral vote, and would in this way have made Mr. Tilden
President had circumstances not happened to break up the
scheme, in consequence of which he went to Baltimore, and
was not in the Senate and did not vote on the subject that
day.</p>

<p>"I was in Washington at the time, and possessed the confidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
of the Democratic leaders, and argued, as you know,
the Florida and Oregon cases. My information was, in one
sense, second hand. I possessed Mr. Conkling's confidence
with regard to the general subject. I knew perfectly what
his views were. He did not hesitate to express them
fully, even going so far as to state them at length
in conversation with myself and my wife and Senator John
W. Stevenson, of Kentucky, on the street in front of the
Arlington, a few days before the decision of the electoral
tribunal. He put the case as it stood in his mind in the
most vivid terms. He was a master of vituperative language,
as you know, and he did not spare anybody; but
more especially he put the matter as a question of law, and
with more ability than I have ever heard it done by any
one else, but I have not time within the confines of a letter
to repeat what he said. Whether Mrs. Sprague was in
Washington at this time I do not know.</p>

<p>"The only person on the Democratic side who communicated
with Mr. Conkling was Senator William H. Barnum,
of Connecticut, chairman of the Democratic National
Executive Committee. Mr. Barnum talked to others, as he
deemed it discreet, but we all thought it unwise that any
one on our side should approach any one on the opposite
side of politics, except Senator Barnum. During the afternoon
of the day before the final vote was given in the Senate
on the Louisiana case, Senator Stevenson, whose daughter
was the wife of one of my partners, and who was until he
died my very dear and honored friend, communicated
to me, as having come to him from Senator Barnum, all
the details of what I may call, for brevity's sake, 'this
plot' to arrest the high-handed dealings of the Republicans,
and I went to bed that night in full confidence that Mr.
Tilden would be placed on a legal basis for inauguration
to the Presidency in the morning. Eight (or nine) Senators
had agreed with each other to cast their votes in the
Senate so as to reverse the judgment of the electoral tribunal
in the Louisiana case.</p>

<p>"When I came down to breakfast in the morning, William
R. Pelton, Gov. Tilden's nephew, told me that 'the fat is
all in the fire'; that at two o'clock in the morning <em>one of
the Senators</em>, whose name, for reasons personal to myself
and to him, I do not feel at liberty to use, had come to
Senator Conkling and told him that he did not dare to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
any further with the enterprise; that his political and perhaps
his personal future would be ruined if he did not vote
for Hayes. Conkling thereupon made up his mind that the
game was lost, and took the earliest train to Baltimore,
where he would, as Pelton said, spend the day, and where
he did, as I afterwards learned, spend the day. Although
I possessed Mr. Conkling's confidence and regard (I have a
letter from him somewhere, couched in more earnest terms
of gratitude than I ever received from any other human
being), I never spoke with him on this subject. My information
was derived entirely from Senator Stevenson and
William T. Pelton, with the latter of whom I was, as I have
already explained I was with the former, on terms of confidence.</p>

<p>"During this period I never heard Mrs. Sprague's name
mentioned. I do not know whether she was in Washington
or not. I was her father's friend, as you probably know,
and I was her friend, and in the matter of the divorce from
Gov. Sprague I was (with Winchester Britton, of Brooklyn)
her counsel, and procured her divorce. I have had many
consultations with both Pelton and his uncle upon various
political and personal matters, but never heard this matter
alluded to by either of them, or by Mrs. Sprague, and I do
not believe that the story has any foundation in truth whatever.
She knew perfectly well, for many years before she
died, that I was a friend of Gov. Tilden's; that my wife
and I both had enjoyed his personal hospitality, and knowing,
as she did, my feelings towards her father, and having
been her legal agent and representative, as I was, in association
with the late Richard T. Merrick, in an attempt,
which never came to daylight, to kill Judge Warden's grotesque
biography of S. P. Chase, this is the first time I ever
heard any interference of hers in the matter of the electoral
tribunal even referred to. Mrs. Sprague has left children
and friends who mourn over her sad fate and grieve at her
death, and, among others,</p>

"<span class="smcap">Geo. Hoadley.</span><br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"[Judge Hoadley's means of information are certainly
unsurpassed. We accept his statement as conclusive on the
point at issue.&mdash;<small>ED.</small> <cite>Evening Post</cite>.]"</p></blockquote>

<p>It was currently rumored in the clubs, and even found
expression in the public prints, that Mrs. Sprague, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
daughter of Chief-Justice Chase, was influential in preventing
Mr. Conkling from taking a stand in the Senate against
the findings and decision of the electoral tribunal in favor
of Mr. Hayes. As the report savored of scandal, it was,
of course, rapidly circulated and heedlessly credited, though
out of respect to all parties interested, the stories slumbered
for many years until the means by which Mr. Hayes was
inaugurated as President could be more dispassionately discussed
than on the eve of the distribution of the patronage
of a new administration. Fourteen years after Hayes' inauguration
the scandal was revived for partisan purposes
in part, and in part, presumably, in the interest of historic
justice. A phase of the discussion at that time in the New
York <cite>Evening Post</cite> provoked the foregoing letter from Hon.
George Hoadley, ex-Governor of Ohio, which probably gives
the most authentic information the country can ever expect
to have of the mysterious and vacillating conduct of Mr.
Conkling. My attention was called to it by the Hon. Smith
Ely, formerly Mayor of New York, to whom I sent the following
acknowledgment:</p>


<h2>JOHN BIGELOW TO HON. SMITH ELY</h2>


<p class="sig">"<span class="smcap">Highland-Falls-on-Hudson</span>, <em>June 19, 1904</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Ely</span>,&mdash;I am extremely obliged to you for
the clipping you sent me from the <cite>Evening Post</cite>. Though
familiar with rumors of that nature, it is the first statement
with any semblance of authenticity I have met with of the
reasons why Conkling did not keep faith with our friends.
I am not sure that Conkling himself did not weaken at the
pinch as much as the recalcitrant Senator. Had he stood
up on that occasion, as he should have done, he would have
established for himself a reputation for virtues which no
biographer can now claim for him.</p>

<p>"I do not remember the name of the Senator alluded
to, because I never knew the fact. Was it Kernan?</p>

<p class="sig">
"Yours truly.
</p>

<p>"P. S.&mdash;Cannot you give us a candidate for the Presidency
without making prostitutes of the judiciary?<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
we made judges elective we went as far in that direction as
was safe, and farther than was prudent. It was a perversion
of the representative system when we submitted the
choice of experts, like judges and district attorneys, to the
popular vote. If we encourage judges to aspire to the
Presidency the suitors for justice will have to take their
check-books to court, and their cases will be argued, as they
are said to be, before Turkish cadis.</p>

</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>About the middle of January, 1877, and before the
Electoral Commission had given its decision, I received a
telegram from Washington that a friend of the Honorable
S. S. Cox, then a representative in Congress from New
York city, wished to confer with me in reference to the
Presidential contest pending in Washington. Cox's friend
proved to be Mr. Corbin, a brother-in-law of President
Grant. I replied to my correspondent that he might arrange
for an interview with me anywhere in New York city except
in Mr. Corbin's house, Corbin at that time having a
residence in New York city.</p>

<p>It was arranged that we should meet at the Westminster
Hotel, about noon, on the 27th of January. I had known
something of Corbin through my relations with Colonel
Benton many years before, and had become slightly acquainted
with him. What I did know of him disinclined
me to give him my confidence. I had no idea of the motive
which led him to invite this interview. He had intimated
to Mr. Cox that he would talk with me, but with no other
of Mr. Tilden's friends. The grounds for his taking me
into his confidence exclusively was equally unintelligible,
beyond the fact that we had been political friends of long
standing as common friends of Senator Thomas Benton, of
Missouri.</p>

<p>He opened the interview by giving at considerable length
what he regarded as evidence of Senator Sherman's expectation
that his brother the general would have been nominated
at Cincinnati in 1876 instead of President Hayes,
and of the intrigues already making for the general's nomination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
of 1880. At length he proceeded to speak for and
in the name of his brother-in-law, the President. He said
Grant wished to retire with grace and honorably from his
office, and had no special interest in the success of either of
the candidates whose fate was depending upon the action
of the Electoral Commission. He said that for himself he
preferred Tilden forty times to Hayes, and that all the
ladies of Grant's family were champions of Tilden. He
wound up by saying that if he could be useful in letting
the President's views be known to Governor Tilden, when
they might serve a useful purpose, he would be glad to do
so, and that that was the special purpose of his inviting
this interview.</p>

<p>I said to him that in a contingency not difficult to imagine
there might be two persons claiming a title to the White
House on the 4th of March, one by the choice of the Senate,
another by the choice of the House of Representatives, and
that it would interest Governor Tilden very much to know
whether General Grant would think it his duty to solve that
problem with the sword, or leave it to the solution of time
and events. Corbin replied that he would tell me what
must not go beyond me and Governor Tilden. Some time
ago, he said, Grant sent a number of boxes to his house at
Elizabeth for safe-keeping, and in stating his intention to
do so, he observed that as the inauguration would occur on
Sunday at 12 <small>M.</small> he proposed to vacate the White House
Saturday night; whoever, therefore, said Corbin, gets
into it first will have a very substantial advantage. The
President might perhaps stay in until the following day
if sufficient reason were shown for so doing. But, said I,
suppose our candidate gets the White House and the other
gets the Capitol, what then? Corbin paused a little, and
then said: "The keeper of the Capitol is under the control of
the Commissioner of Public Buildings. The Commissioner
of Public Buildings is an engineer officer, under the orders
of Chief-Engineer Humphreys. The present Commissioner
of Public Buildings is Babcock; like St. Paul, he is generally
believed to have an eye 'to the recompense of reward.'
Then, those Irish doorkeepers may be worth looking to."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
Such was the substance of an interview which occupied about
two hours.</p>

<p>What may have prompted Corbin to take the trouble to
come all the way from Washington to give me this hint, beyond
a desire to give himself importance in the eyes of Mr.
Tilden, and how far President Grant countenanced his mission,
if he knew anything about it, are questions which I
never troubled myself to solve. There is no doubt that
President Grant thought Tilden had been elected, and found
no satisfaction in the prospect of having Hayes for his successor;
but if he had wished to convey to Mr. Tilden any
intimation that he would find the White House vacant and
ready for his occupation on the night of the 3d of March,
I find it difficult to believe that he would have selected Corbin
for his emissary. However that may be, neither Mr.
Tilden nor myself thought his communication worthy of
serious consideration.</p>

<p>On the second day of March the House of Representatives,
by a vote of 137 to 88, adopted the preamble and resolutions
which follow, declaring that Samuel J. Tilden had
been duly elected President, and Thomas A. Hendricks duly
elected Vice-President of the United States. If these 137
votes in favor of Tilden and Hendricks represented the requisite
constitutional number of States in the Union, it is not
easy to see what more was necessary to make the one President
and the other Vice-President two days later than simply
to take the oaths of office prescribed by the Constitution.</p>


<h2>RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
DECLARING TILDEN THE PRESIDENT ELECTED</h2>

<p>The following is the text of the declaration of the House
of Representatives that Samuel J. Tilden has been duly

<h2>H. A. POPE TO TILDEN</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Columbus, Miss.</span>, <i>Jany. 8, '77</i>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Hon. Saml. J. Tilden.</span>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Although a citizen in private life, I, nevertheless,
feel, I trust, as profound interest as any one in the
welfare of our common country. In its life it has had crises,
but none more alarming since '60 than that which grows out
of the Presidential election between you and Gen. Hayes.</p>

<p>"Of your election I do not entertain a doubt; and it were
simply to render our beautiful system of self-government on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
the part of the people a burlesque and reproach to allow a
set of gambling politicians to set at defiance the expressed
will of the sovereign people.</p>

<p>"Of course we of the South are powerless in the premises,
and were it otherwise I am not prepared altogether to suggest
the proper course. At this critical juncture peace is
more than ever a social and political necessity. But, then,
how can we ever expect to preserve constitutional liberty if
such a precedent&mdash;so violative and destructive of the distinctive
and peculiar feature of our more peculiar system of
govt., submission to the legally expressed will of the majority&mdash;is
tolerated.</p>

<p>"To you, sir, I look for counsel, and I trust you will be
endowed with more than your recognized distinguished
sagacity.</p>

<p>"I have been very much surprised, and not a little
amused, at the contradictory opinions which even the learned
in the law and governmental science have given both as to
the law and practice in the case of the counting of the electoral
votes, and as to the ultimate tribunal known to the
Constitution as the final arbiter in the premises. Cushing,
the learned parliamentarian, and no mean statesman, has
gone so far as to intimate Gen. Grant could, under certain
circumstances which may exist, hold over after the 4th
of March next and continuously&mdash;till, indeed, the succession
transpires; and so teaches Senator Bogy in a speech in
St. Louis.</p>

<p>"A fearful and most dangerous suggestion, verily! And
amazing that it should ever have found lodgment and utterance
from so distinguished a source. But it has not the
semblance of law or the slightest approach to truth in it.</p>

<p>"Cushing reasons from analogy, and says because officers
in many of the States hold over till their successors are installed
he therefore sees no reason why Gen. Grant should
not do so.</p>

<p>"The ready answer to this opinion, however, is very
plain and fatal to the force implied in it. In the case of the
State officer, he acts in the instance mentioned by express
authority of law. But in the case of the President, he is
elected for a term of four years, no more or less, and there
being no enabling act authorizing him to protract the term
a moment beyond the limitation mentioned, should he do so
he would be a usurper and deserve death as such at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
hands of any citizen. In the cases you at once see there is
no analogy whatever, and hence Cushing is certainly mistaken.
As to the force and aspect of the 22d rule or any
other rule or rules, about which a volume has been written,
in solving adverse views, a word or two disposes of them.
They are these modes of procedure&mdash;centures of the private
action of both Houses of Congress, adopted for their convenience
and the harmonious despatch of business. But
they are dead letters if they contravene the Constitution of
the U. S. or attempt to execute any of its requirements.</p>

<p>"Laws are required for the purpose, and not rules. Laws
to which all the departments of legislation are necessarily,
by law, parties&mdash;Congress and the Executive.</p>

<p>"As rules, moreover, they bind only the particular Congress
adopting them; and do not lap over, save by acquiescence,
express or implied. Hence, as I've said, the 22d rule
is dead till revived as suggested, and has therefore no application
to the case between you and Hayes.</p>

<p>"But to the general issue. In the event it should be
formed from any cause, real or supposed, and <em>purely in the
opinion and discretion of Congress</em>, neither you nor Mr.
Hayes has the requisite number of 185 electoral votes required
to confer the office, then to my apprehension the 12th
amendment becomes the law of the case&mdash;<em>exclusively and
supremely so</em>.</p>

<p>"It refers the whole question to Congress, and if, upon
a review of the facts in the case, if it should decide there
has been no election and the two Houses <em>can't agree that

then <em>the House</em> must <em>choose the President</em> and the Senate

<h2>GEO. W. MORGAN TO TILDEN</h2>

<h3>(ABOUT INSIDE HISTORY OF LATE CONVENTION)</h3>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Mount Vernon, Ohio</span>, <i>Jan. 15, 1877</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Mr. President</span>,&mdash;A word as to the inside
history of our late convention. Knowing the temper of our
people, as a precaution against extreme action I wrote to
Governor Allen, and to Hancock, of Texas, asking for letters
which I could use in committee on resolutions by way
of modifying of the wild advice which was certain to be
given. Allen answered: 'In the present condition of things,
threats of force and war would, in my judgment, very greatly
prejudice our cause.'</p>

<p>"Hancock answered by a long letter, conservative in its
tone. In conclusion he said: 'It is inconsistent with the
genius of our institutions that any official position should
be attained by force of arms. A result so accomplished
would be a sad commentary on our statesmanship, and nothing
but a correction by the people through peaceful modes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
would prevent our becoming Mexicanized, and the loss of
republican government.'</p>

<p>"I read these letters to the committee. To the letter of
Allen no comment was made, but Mr. Hancock's was objected
to by Mr. Hurd on the ground that Hancock had been
a Union man in Texas during the war. It was desired that
either Mr. Cook or myself should be chairman of the committee.
He declined on the ground of ill-health, and I foresaw
that the tone of the resolutions was likely to be extreme.</p>

<p>"A sub-committee, composed of White, Heisley, Ewing,
Vance, and myself, was appointed to report resolutions for
the action of the full committee. The first and fifth resolutions
were mine. The third was drawn by Alex. Long
or Hurd. Heisley moved to strike out of that resolution
all after 'will be resisted by the people.' The vote stood:</p>

<p>"Ayes&mdash;Heisley and Morgan.</p>

<p>"Noes&mdash;Ewing, Vance, and White.</p>

<p>"Ewing then moved to strike out all after the words 'last
extremity.' The vote stood:</p>

<p>"Ayes&mdash;Ewing, Heisley, and Morgan.</p>

<p>"Noes&mdash;White and Vance.</p>

<p>"When the sub-committee reported to the committee,
Hurd moved to amend by adding after the words 'last extremity'
the words, 'even to an appeal to arms.' In the
mean time Ward had been called away to preside over the
convention, and some one else withdrew. The vote was
nine for the amendment, eight against it. The resolution
as to the national convention would have been carried by the
same vote, but after a declaration in favor of an appeal to
arms it was allowed to go by default. All of the speeches
but my own were written and in type before the convention
met. The convention struck up the 'Marseillaise,' and I
took step to the music.</p>

<p>"I still have strong hopes of your inauguration, and if
you are not our country will be in peril.</p>

<p>"With great respect,</p>

<p class="sig">
Truly yours,<br />

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;From some cause yours of the 13th instant
has only this morning been received. My engagements are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
such as to prevent me from being with you to-morrow. All
movements, political or otherwise, must have a recognized
leader. Mr. Tilden is ours. I have reason to believe that
the action of our convention went beyond his wishes. Mr.
Pelton wrote to me just before our convention, and not long
since I had a note from Mr. Hewitt. The tone of both indicate
a policy less pronounced than that taken by Ohio.</p>

<p>"The last clause of our third resolution was adopted by
one majority, and would have been rejected had not two of
the committee been absent when the vote was taken. I regret
that I cannot have a full exchange of views with the gentlemen
to be present. My judgment is that we should defer to
the views of Messrs. Tilden and Hendricks.</p>

<h2>CHARLES F. ADAMS TO TILDEN</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">31 Pemberton Square, Boston</span>, <i>16th Jan., 1877</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Tilden</span>,&mdash;You must excuse me for failing
to call on you at 11 o'cl. Monday, as you requested. The
snow-storm worked a very sudden change in my plans, and
I hurriedly took the morning train for Boston instead of
the afternoon, as I intended.</p>

<p>"For the object I had in view, however, my failure to
see you again is of little consequence. Mr. Godwin is fully
possessed of my views, and, if they are worth anything, can
present them to you.</p>

<p>"The point can be stated in a few words. I am impressed
with the idea that the true lead to get us out of our present
complication should come from the two Presidential candidates,
and not from irresponsible gatherings or a Congressional
town-meeting. If the candidates could agree on a
practical way out of the trouble, and unite in jointly recommending
it to Congress and the country, its adoption would
seem inevitable. To bring this about the candidates must
be put in communication with each other, the way for which
is rendered perfectly simple and obvious through the friendly
relations still existing between those who joined in the
5th Avenue conference of last spring.</p>

<p>"My own view is that nothing will satisfactorily settle
this question but an appeal to the ballot. The simple, fundamental,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
direct, democratic appeal to the one great tribunal.
If the two candidates would unite in asking to have
the people decide between them the path would be plain.
But I will not dilate on this, as, if you want my views in
detail, Mr. Godwin can give them to you.</p>

<p>"Begging you again to excuse my failure to call upon
you, I remain, etc.,</p>

<h2>LOUISE LIVINGSTON HUNT TO TILDEN</h2>

<p class="sig">"(<i>Jan. 21, '77.</i>)
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Governor Tilden</span>,&mdash;I have just received a letter
from my brother in New Orleans, a portion of which I
copy, because I feel sure it will interest you as an evidence
of the genuine feeling at present in Louisiana.</p>

<p>"He says: 'Our people are in an <em>admirable temper</em>, and
will do their whole duty. You will find Nichols all that
you pronounce him, and I agree with you in thinking he has
outshone even Hampton. The latter made a bad mistake in
writing to the Pretender Hayes. Has not Mr. Tilden proved
himself? Has he not led the South with consummate success
until she has for the first time a fair prospect? He
has, God bless him for it, shown the whole country a new
future, and aroused in it the ancient spirit of truth and
courage and zeal for liberty. Nowhere has he been stronger
than in his perception of the capacity and will of the people,
in his faith in their public virtue and attachment to free
government, which ever did and ever must depend upon an
honest count of the ballots lawfully cast. The change you
observe in public opinion announcing his expected appearance
in the Presidency will continue to grow until he is borne
where he merits to be&mdash;into his great office.'</p>

<p>"How I wish, instead of being only a woman at such a
time as this, that I were a Senator or member, endowed with
the bold spirit and overruling genius of your own great ancestor!
There would be quick work with the present Congress
at Washington!</p>

<p>"Forgive me if my letter makes the one-hundredth-and-one
of the day; it requires no answer. One word more before
I stop. On reflection, I am certain my Uncle Randall
alluded to the fact that I was the favorite niece of Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
Edward Livingston, my grandaunt, who died not many
years since, at a very advanced age. I was very stupid not

<h2>THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION AND MR. TILDEN</h2>

<p>The following statement, in the handwriting of George W.
Smith, Mr. Tilden's private secretary, was from Mr. Tilden's
dictation:</p>

<p>"Mr. Tilden's views of the policy which the Democratic
party in Congress ought to pursue in respect to the counting
of the electoral votes cast for President and Vice-President
in 1876 were perfectly defined and freely expressed to
all who consulted him long before the meeting of Congress
in December of that year. It was to stand firmly and
inflexibly on the unbroken series of precedents formed by
the twenty-two Presidential counts from 1793 to 1872.</p>

<p>"While the committees of investigation in respect to
Louisiana, Florida, and South Carolina, appointed by the
House of Representatives, were engaged in their duties, Mr.
Tilden caused a collection of all those precedents to be made
and printed. At his request the Hon. John Bigelow prepared
an analytical and expository introduction which was
prefixed to this volume, and they were printed together by
the Messrs. Appleton in the latter part of December, 1876.
Mr. Marble assisted in preparing an appendix to the introduction,
containing citations of authorities on the various
points. This introduction was also issued separately and
used in large numbers by the Democratic National Committee.
It presents a clear, strong, and well-fortified statement
of the position which Mr. Tilden thought the Democratic
party ought to assume.</p>

<p>"On the 22d December two committees of the House of
Representatives were appointed: the first on the powers and
privileges of the House of Representatives in respect to
counting electoral votes; the second to confer with a committee
of the Senate on the same subject. The <cite>Congressional
Record</cite> of that date contains the following entry:</p>

<p>"'<i>Committee to ascertain and report what are the privileges,</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
<i>powers, and duties of the House of Representatives
in counting the votes for President and Vice-President of
the United States</i>: Mr. Knott, of Kentucky; Mr. Sparks, of
Illinois; Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, of Virginia; Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, of Pennsylvania;
Mr. Burchard, of Illinois; Mr. Seelye, of Massachusetts;
and Mr. Monroe, of Ohio.</p>

<p>"'<i>Committee to meet with the Senate committee as to the
counting of the electoral votes for President and Vice-President</i>:
Mr. Payne, of Ohio; Mr. Hunton, of Virginia; Mr.
Hewitt, of New York; Mr. Springer, of Illinois; Mr.
McCrary, of Iowa; Mr. Hoar, of Massachusetts; and Mr.
Willard, of Michigan.'</p>

<p>"During the Christmas holidays, and for some days after
the 1st of January, leading members of the House of Representatives
were in New York and had interviews with Mr.
Tilden. He was frank, open, and earnest in his conversations
with them, and with many others, in advocating the
making of an issue first in the House of Representatives and
then in the Senate. He was for asserting, by formal resolution,
the exclusive right of the two Houses acting concurrently
to count the electoral vote and determine what should
be counted as electoral votes, and for denying, also by formal
resolution, the pretension then set up by the Republicans,
that the president of the Senate had any lawful or constitutional
right to assume that function. He was for urging
that issue in debate in both Houses and before the country.
He thought that if the attempt should be really made to usurp
for the president of the Senate a power to make the count
and thus practically control the Presidential election, the
scheme would break down in process of execution, and that,
in any event, it was in the interest of popular elective government
not to yield to the menace of usurpation, all which
actual usurpation could take for itself if completely successful.</p>

<p>"On the request of some member of the House of Representatives,
Mr. Tilden himself drew two resolutions for the
purpose of making this issue. The Democratic members of
the Committee on Privileges, &amp;c., found themselves best able
to agree on the simplest form of asserting their principles
and deemed that most expedient. Resolutions of that character
were prepared by them, transmitted to Mr. Tilden for
his advice, and returned with his approval. These resolutions
were reported by the Hon. Proctor Knott, chairman of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
the committee. They will be found in the Congressional
Record of Jan. 12, 1877. They are as follows:</p>

<p>"This policy seemed to have been generally agreed upon
by the Democratic members of the House of Representatives,
and it had been recommended persistently by Mr. Tilden
for weeks to all who consulted him upon the subject.</p>

<p>"On the afternoon of Friday the 12th of January, Senator
Barnum, passing through New York on his way home for
the purpose of getting his family to take them to Washington
on the following Tuesday, called on Mr. Tilden and expressed
his conviction that a majority of the Senators would
concur in denying the right of the president of the Senate
to make the count. He had not heard a word of the proposed
electoral contrivance. It was afterwards ascertained that the
Democratic Senator from New York had been left in equal
ignorance.</p>

<p>"On the evening of Saturday, 13th of January, Mr.
Marble called on Mr. Tilden, found him in receipt of the
McCrary House bill with the amendments proposed by Mr.
Hewitt, and a letter from Mr. Hewitt informing him that
his counsel would be asked the next day about this bill. Mr.
Tilden and Mr. Marble sat late into the night analyzing it.
Mr. Tilden invited Mr. Marble to come the next day when
Mr. Hewitt should be there to consider this bill, which was
supposed to be the axis upon which the deliberations of the
House were revolving.</p>

<p>"Mr. Marble was therefore present on the following day,
which was the 14th of January, when Mr. Tilden received
from Mr. Hewitt his first information that the other measures
had been abandoned, and that the subject upon which he
wished to confer was the Electoral bill.</p>

<p>"Before he read the new bill Mr. Tilden was told that the
Democratic members of the Senate committee were already
absolutely committed to this bill, and would concur with
the Republican members of the committee in reporting it
to the Senate whether the House committee should concur
or not.</p>

<p>"'Is it not rather late, then, to consult me?' said Mr.
Tilden.</p>

<p>"'They do not consult you,' replied Mr. Hewitt. 'They
are public men and have their own duties and responsibilities.
I consult you.'</p>

<p>"The examination and analysis of the bill then proceeded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
Mr. Tilden said, in the progress of the conference, 'I can't
advise you to agree to the bill. I will advise you as to its
details.'</p>

<p>"In respect to the provision by which six judges were
to be described in the bill and one of them to be eliminated
by lot, Mr. Tilden said, emphatically, 'I may lose the Presidency,
but I will not raffle for it.'</p>

<p>"Mr. Tilden further said, if an arbitration were to be
adopted, the tribunal ought to be fixed in the bill itself and
not left to chance or intrigue.</p>

<p>"He said, also, that if an arbitration were to be adopted,
the duty of the arbitrators to investigate and decide the
case on its <em>merits</em> should be made mandatory and not left
as a question of construction.</p>

<p>"With both the vital points, the choice of men to compose
the tribunal and a function to be performed by the tribunal,
left at loose ends, he treated the whole thing as a sort of
gamble.</p>

<p>"In the course of the discussion Mr. Tilden said: 'If you
go into a conference with your adversary and can't break
off because you feel you must agree to something you cannot
negotiate&mdash;you are not fit to negotiate. You will be beaten
upon every detail.'</p>

<p>"Replying to the apprehensions of a collision of force
with the executive, Mr. Tilden thought them exaggerated,
but said: 'Why surrender now? You can always surrender.
Why surrender before the battle, for fear you may have to
surrender after the battle is over?'</p>

<p>"Mr. Tilden was pressed to say that if the bill could be
modified so as to fix the five judges by a position provision,
he would give it his approval, and it was urged that a modification
could not succeed unless it was stated that that would
make the bill acceptable. He firmly declined.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hewitt stated that the committees of the two Houses
were to meet that evening at the house of Senator Bayard,
and that he was expected to telegraph them the result of his
interview.</p>

<p>"It was perfectly evident that what was sought was not
Mr. Tilden's advice, but Mr. Tilden's adhesion. His refusal
to give it caused the meeting for that evening to fall
through.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tilden condemned the proposed action as precipitate.
It was a month before the time for the count, and he saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
no reason why there should not be an opportunity afforded
for consideration and consultation by the representatives of
the people. He treated it as a panic in which they were
liable to act in haste and repent at leisure. He did not ask
any time for himself or time to decide what he would do
in respect to the proposed means. He never for a moment
evinced the slightest hesitation or doubt about that; he was
clear and inflexible, but he advised more deliberation upon
the part of those who were to act in Washington. He believed
in publicity and discussion and a wider consultation.
He had an inherent and incurable distrust of the scheme,
and has frequently said since that so great a stake as the
government of forty millions of people with immense civil
expenditures and a hundred thousand office-holders to be
disposed of by a small body sitting in the Capitol would become
the sport of intrigue or fraud.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tilden also disapproved of the secrecy with which
the proceedings were shrouded. He thought it unwise to
compromise the rights of the members of the two Houses
without consulting them, by taking a hasty step which left no
different policy practicable than the one thus imposed. Two
days later, in a telegram to Mr. Hewitt, he expressed himself
again and decidedly on this subject.</p>

<p>"In the whole of this conference Mr. Tilden was never
asked to advise what the two committees should do jointly
or what the Senate committee should do. He was expressly
and repeatedly told that the Senate committee, including the
Democratic members, Messrs. Bayard, Thurman, and Ransom,
had already determined upon their course whatever his
advice or wishes might be. The difficulty on the part of the
House committee, in carrying out an independent policy,
was pressed upon him as a reason for advising their acquiescence.
No argument or persuasion could extract from
him a word of personal sanction to the scheme. If, however,
it was to be adopted, if it was a foregone conclusion, he
manifested a desire that the provisions of the bill should be
made to operate as much good and as little mischief as possible,
both in their legal effect and in the manner of their
execution. He was willing to advise and help in respect to
specific provisions, but took care, in doing so, not incidentally
to adopt the bill.</p>

<p>"The next day, Jan. 15th, Mr. Hewitt telegraphed from
Washington to Mr. Edward Cooper:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"'<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, <i>Jany. 15, 187-</i>.</p>

<p>"'To E. C.
</p>

<p>"'The Senate committee will probably reject five- and
report six-judge plan immediately. Our Senators feel committed
to concur. House committee will not concur, and for
present will probably not report.'</p></blockquote>

<p>"The answer was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"'<span class="smcap">N. Y.</span> <i>Jany. 15, 187-</i>.</p>

<p>"'To A. S. H.
</p>

<p>"'Procrastinate to give few days for information and
consultation. The six-judge proposition inadmissible.</p>

<p class="sig">
"'E. C.'
</p></blockquote>

<p>"On the following day Mr. Hewitt telegraphed again:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"'<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, <i>Jany. 16, 187-</i>.</p>
<p>
"'To E. C.
</p>

<p>"'After protracted negotiations Senator receded from six-judge.
Declined five-judge and offered four senior associate
justices who are to choose the fifth judge excluding chief
justice. Our Senate friends earnestly favor acceptance, because
they don't believe it possible to pass over Field. The
Democrats on the House committee believe this is the last
chance of agreement. We cannot postpone beyond eleven
to-morrow, and if we decline Senate committee will report
their original plan to which our friends are committed.
Telegraph your advice.'</p></blockquote>

<p>"To this telegram the following answer was sent:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"'<span class="smcap">N. Y.</span>, <i>Jany. 17, 2 a.m.</i>
</p>

<p>"'Be firm and cool. Four-judge plan will not do. Perhaps
worse than six. Complaints likely to arise of haste and
want of consultation with members, and embarrassment in
exercise of their judgment after plan is disclosed by premature
committal of their representatives. There should be
more opportunity for deliberation and consultation. Secrecy
dangerous; probably mistake in itself, and if it results in
disaster would involve great blame and infinite mischief.'</p></blockquote>

<p>"In the evening of Tuesday, the 16th of January, Mr.
Marble went to see Mr. Tilden and found him in his library.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
Several other gentlemen were present. The foregoing telegrams
were read. The situation was freely canvassed. In
their presence, Mr. Tilden dictated another and longer telegram,
which was sent to the committee-room for transmission
to Washington. As it was translated into cypher at the committee
rooms and had to be retranslated at Washington, it
was not delivered until after the committees had taken
definitive action. It was not addressed to Mr. Hewitt and
therefore was not seen by him. The only value of this telegram
now is as a record made at the time in the presence of
half a dozen well-known gentlemen, of Mr. Tilden's views,
similar to those he had habitually expressed and somewhat
fuller than in the other telegrams.</p>

<p>"Mr. Marble having seen all these telegrams at the time,
and being familiar with them, requested copies for the present
occasion. In assenting to that request, Mr. Tilden desired
Mr. Marble, in any use he might make of them, to
say explicitly that Mr. Tilden has never doubted Mr.
Hewitt's perfect good faith in the transaction to which the
telegrams relate, and believes him to have been actuated by
the most patriotic motives.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
<i>"'Jany. 17, 1877 Midnight</i>.
</p>

<p>"'No need of hot haste, but much danger in it. Some
days' interval should be taken; the risk of publicity harmless.
No information here nor any opportunity to get information
which could justify abstinence from condemning
such an abandonment of the Constitution and practice of the
government, and of the rights of the two Houses and of the
people. Nothing but great and certain public danger not to
be escaped in any other way could excuse such a measure.
We are overpressed by exaggerated fears and forget that the
other side will have greater troubles than we unless relieved
by some agreement. They have no way out but by usurpation;
are bullying us with what they dare not do or will
break down in attempting. So long as we stand on the Constitution
and settled practice we know where we are. Consequences
of new expedient not enough considered. Only
way of getting accessions in the Senate is by House standing
firm&mdash;and judicious friends believe in that case we will go
safely through. Opportunity to consult such friends should
be given before even tacit acquiescence, if that is contemplated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
Though details may be properly discussed, final
committal by House committee should be firmly withheld.'"</p></blockquote>

<h2>THE HAYES FRAUD AND THE LOUISIANA LOTTERY</h2>

<h3>(<i>From the "Sun," Friday, November 20, 1891.</i>)</h3>

<p>"We print elsewhere an interesting review of the events
which have brought the Louisiana Lottery question to its
present familiar phase.</p>

<p>"According to this statement, which is verifiable so far
as it deals with the open facts of history, one of the most
powerful influences in enabling Mr. R. B. Hayes to carry
out the infamous political bargain which was the result
of the Wormley conference, was that of the Louisiana
Lottery.</p>

<p>"The representatives of Mr. Hayes secured the completion
of the electoral count at Washington in 1877 by pledging
the fraudulent administration, in advance, to do certain
things desired by certain Southern Democrats. One of these
things was to accomplish the overthrow of Packard in Louisiana,
although Packard had received for Governor in that
State a vote larger than Hayes' for President.</p>

<p>"When Mr. Hayes was seated in the office to which he had
not been elected, he proceeded to redeem the promises made
in his behalf by Stanley Matthews and Charles Foster. But
he was able to fulfil his part of the bargain mainly through
the intervention of the Lottery Company, which furnished
at New Orleans a sufficient number of Republican legislators
elect, willing to join with the Democrats in organizing
the Legislature that destroyed Packard and seated
Nicholls.</p>

<p>"Thus the bargain was carried out upon Mr. Hayes' side
by the assistance of the concern once powerfully described
by the Hon. Benjamin Harrison as the Great Beast. And
to that service on the part of the Great Beast, according to
our correspondent's recital of the facts, the Louisiana Lottery
owes in return its present position of advantage in the
State.</p>

<p>"Is there any doubt as to the pledge to overthrow Packard,
which the Great Beast helped Hayes to redeem? Mr.
William H. Roberts of New Orleans, among others, has
testified that when the electoral count was pending, he received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
this assurance from a distinguished Republican statesman
and a close personal friend of Mr. Hayes:</p>

<p>"'You need not be uneasy. I see that you are all restless
and nervous; I see that Blackburn and those men are controlling
the Southern men. I assure you that it will be all
right; and when I assure you that you are to have your State
government, you ought to know me well enough to know that
I am telling you the truth.'"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The distinguished Republican statesman and personal
friend of Hayes was the Hon. Charles Foster, of Fostoria,
Secretary of the Treasury under the administration of the
Great Beast's enemy, the Hon. Benjamin Harrison.</p>

<p>Is there any doubt as to the understanding of the pledge
by the Southern Democrats who were active in arranging the
bargain, afterwards carried out by Hayes with the aid of the
Louisiana Lottery? "If we should lose the national government
we may be able to save Louisiana," said the Hon.
Lucius Q. C. Lamar to Mr. Roberts of New Orleans early
in the progress of the negotiations. And later, when certain
Democrats in the House were proposing to stand out to the
last against the consummation of the fraud, Judge Lamar
sent to one of their number, the Hon. John Ellis of Louisiana,
this letter of vindication and appeal:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have just learned from an unquestionable authority,
which I will give, if you wish it, that Foster said to a gentleman,
my informant, that the speech he made to-day, which
so significantly but indirectly hints at Hayes' Southern
policy, that he made it after consultation with Mr. Matthews,
Mr. Hayes' brother-in-law, and Mr. Matthews told him and
urged him to say squarely that Hayes would have nothing
to do or to say to Packard.</p>

<p>"Now, Ellis, this is the first thing I have ever heard as
coming from Hayes, directly or indirectly, that is worth
acting upon by any Southern man. We do not want offices,
but we do want to get our States and our people free from
the carpet-bag government. Ought you not, if an available
opportunity offers you to serve your State and people, to
spring forward at once and see if you can't free your State?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
I think you should at once see Mr. Stanley Matthews and ask
him if Governor Hayes will give you some assurance that
he will not nominate Packard in his domination of your
people."</p></blockquote>

<p>This Judge Lamar is the gentleman who afterwards served
as a member of Mr. Cleveland's cabinet, and who received
from Mr. Cleveland an appointment to the bench of the
Supreme Court of the United States.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Judge</span>,&mdash;The son of Judge Josiah Gardner
Abbott, of Mass., handed me a few days since in Boston a
copy of the proposed address of the minority of the electoral
commission of 1877 protesting against the decisions of the
majority of that commission. At the close of this address,
or somewhere on it, was the following endorsement:</p>

<p>"'This address was drawn up at the request of some of

it was submitted and approved by them. But some doubted
the wisdom of publishing the address at the time, and so it
was not signed.</p>

<p>"I would like much to know if the Democratic minority
concurred in this protest, and the reasons which decided them
or any of them against its publication. I am expecting to
be delivered one of these days of something about that electoral
commission, and, of course, I would like to speak of
this address, if at all, by the book. I would like, also, to
know if you can tell me why Judge Abbott refused to allow
of the publication in his lifetime; if there was any other
reason than that it was never signed.</p>

<h2>STEPHEN J. FIELD TO BIGELOW</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Supreme Court of the United States</span>,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Washington, D. C.</span>, <i>February 2, 1894</i>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Hon. John Bigelow.</span>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your letter of the 31st of January was received
yesterday. You state that the son of the late Judge
Josiah Gordon Abbott, of Massachusetts, had handed to you
a few days before, in Boston, a copy of 'The proposed address
of the minority of the electoral commission of 1877,
protesting against the decision of the majority of that commission,'
and add that at the close of the address, or somewhere
in it, was the following endorsement: 'This address
was drawn up at the request of some of the minority members
of the electoral commission, to whom it was submitted
and approved by them; but some doubted the wisdom of publishing
the address at the time, and so it was not signed.
(Signed) <span class="smcap">J. G. Abbott</span>.'</p>

<p>"You express a wish to know if the Democratic minority
concurred in this protest, and the reasons which decided
them, or any of them, against its publication. In answer to
your inquiry, I would state that I remember very well the
preparation of the address undertaken by Mr. Abbott, the
draft of which was submitted to me and approved, and I
supposed then that it would receive the signatures of all the
members of the Democratic minority and be published.
Soon afterwards Mr. Abbott informed me that some of the
members of the minority had expressed a doubt of the wisdom
of publishing the address at that time. It was not,
therefore, signed. I know of no other reason. None was
given that I can recall except the existence of the doubt
mentioned.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Mr. Bayard could give you more definite information
upon this point. I know that it was a disappointment
to me that the address, either as prepared, or as it
might be amended by suggestions of members of the Democratic
minority, was not published.</p>

<p>"I think that when the members of the commission separated
it was Mr. Abbott's intention to prepare some document
with reference to the action of the commission for
publication, with the consent of other members of the minority,
but that intention was subsequently abandoned by
him for reasons which I cannot state.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span></p>

<p>"You also state that you would like to know if I could
tell you why Judge Abbott refused to allow of the publication
in his lifetime. I know of none except the fact that
the document was never signed. Some years afterwards,
when Mr. Abbott was at Washington, he expressed to me a
regret that the document which he had prepared had not been
signed and published.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>The following letter, received in reply to one addressed
to its writer by Mr. George W. Smith, one of the executors
and trustees of Mr. Tilden's estate, gives the substance of a
very important statement bearing upon the election for President
in Louisiana in '76, the authorship of which statement,
however, is suppressed in compliance with the request and
for the reasons assigned by the one who heard it. As the
gentleman, whose name is here left blank, has long been dead,
it is permissible to say that he was quite the most prominent
Republican politician in Louisiana at the time the statement
purports to have been made.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Smith</span>,&mdash;Your letter of April 4th came this
morning, having been forwarded from home.</p>

<p>"The letter you speak of is not in existence, having been
destroyed when I broke up my home ten years ago. It was
not from Kellogg, but from &mdash;&mdash;. That part referring to
the election read about as follows:</p>

<p>"'You ask as to the election. Tilden carried the State
by 9 to 14,000 (I am not positive as to the figures, either
may be wrong), but this will be overcome in some way; how
has not as yet been decided, but you can be certain the State
will be returned for Hayes.'</p>

<p>"I cannot be mistaken as to the substance of his letter, as
it made a deep impression on me at the time. Had it not
been personal and <em>confidential</em>, I should have given it publicity
at the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span></p>

<p>"In case Mr. Bigelow should make any use of it&mdash;the
information&mdash;kindly see that he avoids using &mdash;&mdash;'s name
for the reasons above given.</p>

<p>"I sincerely regret I cannot produce the letter itself or
make a more satisfactory reply to your inquiry.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Wilcox formerly resided in Louisiana, and &mdash;&mdash; was
a frequent guest at her father's house, which explains
the frankness of his answer to her letter asking for information
in the matter.</p>

<h2>WILLIAM BIGLER TO TILDEN</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Clearfield, Pa.</span>, <i>Jan. 24th, 1877</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;After a careful examination of all the
plans of adjusting the Presidential embroglio at Washington,
I came to the conclusion that the plan reported by the
committee is the best&mdash;most certain to promote the peace and
dignity of the country, and to secure your inauguration as
President. In the first place it involves an abandonment of
the plea for the right of the president of the Senate, and in
the next it recognizes the right of the commission to go behind
the certificates on an allegation of fraud. Besides, I
have special confidence in one of the judges who will be
selected as a Republican. He will be just and impartial in
his action, with slight inclination to our side.</p>

<p>"The difficulty in the way of the power of the House consists
in the obstacles that can be interposed against reaching
the point at which that power can be safely and properly
exercised. The order laid down in the Constitution must
be followed. First, the certificates shall be opened. Second,
the vote shall then be counted. Third, if there has been a
failure to elect by the States then the House shall immediately
proceed to elect a President. The counting will go on
smoothly until Florida is reached, and then objection will
be made and the Senate will retire. It will decide to count
the vote for Mr. Hayes, and the House will reject the vote
or count it for you, and then when will they come together
again? Perhaps at the end of a week the House may give
up Florida to go on with the count and then will come Louisiana,
and this the House cannot yield without losing everything.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
Some say at this point the House should proceed to
elect a President, but the vote has not been counted as the
Constitution requires, and the assumption that there has
been no election in the face of the fact that there are but
two candidates, and that it is not possible to so divide the vote
as to have a tie, cannot be overlooked. The plan of conceding
everything but Oregon, which comes last, has been favored
by some. My own impression is that you will become
President by the rejection of the vote of Louisiana. That
will be done by the commission, and may be done by a vote
of the Senate. I think the vote in the Senate, taken at any
time, would be very close on the rejection of the vote of
Louisiana.</p>

<p>"The danger now is that the plan of the committees will
be defeated by persistent debate. I have no fear of Grant.
At present he would sign the bill.</p>

<p>"I should have remained at Washington but for an imperious
demand for me in a business matter at this place.</p>

<p>"With much esteem I remain,</p>

<h2>TILDEN TO GOVERNOR WADE HAMPTON</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <i>Feb. 3, 1877</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Gov. Hampton</span>,&mdash;I have just emerged from ten
days of exceptional intensity of pressure in occupations,
which at best were not light. During this time your letter
of the 22d Jany. arrived. It does not seem to me more than
two or three days since I first saw it, but my count of time
may have been imperfect.</p>

<p>"Certain I am that I take my first interval to acknowledge
it and to reply.</p>

<p>"One only of the newspaper publications which you mentioned
had come under my observation; and that I had
cursorily looked at rather than read.</p>

<p>"It is enough to say that none of these criticisms has made
the least impression on my mind unfavorable to your perfect
good faith in your political actions or relations, or to my
confidence in your friendly disposition toward me. You
were quite right in thinking, as you say, that an explanation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
was unnecessary, though for great caution you have chosen
to write to me on the subject. I have not only faith in you,
but great admiration for your personal bearing under difficult
and trying circumstances. I have no element of suspicion
in my nature, and have looked on the recent contest
in no selfish aspect, not even in that refined form which
thinks of the honor of being associated with the right in so
great a cause. And I appreciate the wrongs to which the
people of your State have been subjected.</p>

and believe me,</p>

<h2>THOMAS COTTMAN TO S. J. TILDEN</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">343 Fifth Avenue, New York</span>, <i>Feby. 22d, 1877</i>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Govr. Saml. J. Tilden.</span>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your card of this morning confirms my
opinion that the defeat of the Democratic party is due
measurably to the manipulation of inexperienced or overconfident
directors. I hope you will insist on Chandler's
exhibit, now they have made all possible mischief out of
your account. There has been too much willingness on the
part of the Democrats to compromise, and Senator Kernan
to say the least of it has acted unwisely. Patrick Kennedy's<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
testimony fully substantiates my views in regard to Louisiana&mdash;Wells
has been unskilfully handled. But there is no
use in crying over spilt milk.</p>

<p>"The 'occasional correspondent' in the <cite>Herald</cite> of this
morning overstates the case in reference to dissatisfaction in
the party. But of its existence no one can doubt. Not so
much South as here and in the West, and from a totally
different cause from that assigned in the <cite>Herald</cite>. I had
opportunities [of] observing it, and exerted my utmost power
to assuage or avert it. There is no necessity now for adverting
to the cause, but I will simply remark that the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
Hunkers considered themselves ignored to give prominence
to Barnburners and new men, personal favorites&mdash;and that
feeling at one time came near losing you this city and Brooklyn.
I have never doubted the feasibility of obtaining a
<em>fair and honest return</em> of the vote in Louisiana, if the proper
means were resorted to which in no wise included pecuniary
consideration. It was a political question and political consideration
was desired as testified by P. I. Kennedy, who is
a very different man from Dr. Hugh Kennedy, whose name
Wells offered as the fifth man on the Returning Board, and
had laid on the table for future action. Whenever I mentioned
the subject to those in <em>authority here</em>, I was met with
the information that Genl. Taylor was <em>here</em> looking to
Louisiana. Genl. Taylor is a very estimable gentleman, but
most cordially hated by both Wells and Kennedy. When I
reflect on the management '<em>here</em>,' I can only say you were
slaughtered in the house of your friends: not from design,
for I believe they were honest and true, zealous and uncompromising,
but conceited from the want of experience in
politics; not the want of capacity, but an overweening confidence
in themselves and the justice of their case. In the
name of Louisiana, I unhesitatingly repudiate the assertion
of the <cite>Herald's</cite> occasional correspondent of an indifference
towards your election. She cast her vote for you, and it
would have been so returned if your lieutenants here had not
overestimated their powers.</p>

<h2>N. W. HAZEN TO S. J. TILDEN</h2>

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Hon. Samuel J. Tilden.</span>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I hope it is not too late to make some use
of the views stated in the paper enclosed, which seem to me
so obvious that I have constantly hoped to see them presented
from some one of many sources.</p>

<p class="sig">
"Very respectfully,<br />
"Your obt. servt.,<br />
"<span class="smcap">N. W. Hazen</span>."
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Whenever it appeared to Congress that no person had a
majority of the electoral votes, the whole subject of the election
of President, by force of the Twelfth Amendment, passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
into the exclusive jurisdiction of the House, and no proposals
for joint proceedings, or for any action by the Senate
in relation to it were in order.</p>

<p>That no person had a majority appeared from the double
returns from some of the States from the opening of the
returns, and is admitted by the passage of the electoral law.</p>

<p>The choice being given to the House by the Constitution,
it belonged to the House solely to make any investigations
which it should find necessary to the proper performance
of this trust.</p>

<p>When the Constitution gives the choice to the House, it
confers by necessary implication whatever authority is requisite
to the full exercise of the power, including, of course,
exclusive control over the whole subject.</p>

<p>It may be remarked, by way of illustration, that the first
duty is to determine who are the three persons from whom a
choice is to be made: acting with the Senate, a fourth person
might be rejected from this number, whom, if he were before
it, a majority of the House might choose to elect.</p>

<p>The record of the proceedings of the commission will show
them to be without warrant or authority in the Constitution,
which contains ample provision upon the same subject.</p>

<p>The commission usurps a power conferred upon the House
when the House itself was established, which is one of its
highest functions, and whose exercise it cannot surrender
without dishonor.</p>

<p>1. Upon the motion to be made in the House to accept
the report of the commission it should not be entertained,
because in violation of the constitutional rights of the House,
and not in order therefore.</p>

<p>2. If it has been accepted, the whole proceedings should
be declared for this reason null and void.</p>

<p>3. The House should proceed to the choice of President
according to the Twelfth Amendment, that it may not fail
in the performance of one of the highest duties it owes to
the Constitution, and in the exercise of its greatest powers;
that some person may be duly chosen, so that its candidate
may have the legal title before the law and before the
people.</p>

<h2>JOHN A. McCLERNAND TO TILDEN</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Springfield, Ill.</span>, <i>March 2nd, 1877</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;It is done, and the Presidential office, fairly
awarded you by the voice of the people and the electoral
colleges, passes to another. I sympathize with you in this
your deprivation of right and official dignity. I sympathize
also with the country in its consequent humiliation. A stain
is cast upon its escutcheon and Republican institutions.</p>

<p>"The result might have been different but for a mistake,
honest, doubtless, though it was. If the chairman of our
national committee had not wavered and hesitated at a decisive
moment, and thereby awakened doubts as to your purpose,
the spirit and courage of the Democracy, then showing
a bold front, would have precluded the possibility of the
electoral commission and its decision, and have settled everything
satisfactorily without a blow. I say this in the belief
that the capital and business of the country would not have
seconded the Republican leaders in an appeal to arms to uphold
fraud and usurpation. Right armed with confidence
is seldom vanquished.</p>

<p>"But regrets are now idle. Our part is to repair the past
in the future. Your leadership in the late canvass regenerated
and renewed the Democratic party, and brought it
back to the mansion of its fathers. It revived its ancient
energy and devotion. It is now capable of great achievements.
This is saying much for both you and it, yet not
more than the truth. You are now the acknowledged leader
of the <em>reform Democracy</em>, and your leadership must be continued
for the contest of 1880. This is the sentiment and
demand of the <i>Old Guard</i> who never desert or surrender.</p>

though I did my best, within the bounds of my influence, to
secure from its action the triumph of truth and justice, I
have the satisfaction to know that from the hour we had the
returns of the Presidential election my utmost effort was
directed to influence the House of Representatives to assert
its constitutional prerogatives and elect a President, rather
than co-operate in the declaration of a result which is false
in fact and which outrages the moral and numerical sense
of the country. If such a result was inevitable, I could accept
it as well as another; but I would have left its consummation

my intense disappointment that you are not to-day the
'<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de facto</i>,' as you truly are the '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de jure</i>' President of our
country. I <em>did</em> believe that the justices of the Supreme
Court would, in a case of such vital interest, rise high above
all party trammels, carefully ascertain the facts of the case,
administer the law with equity and consistency, and hold to
the doctrine that fraud must vitiate the acts it was employed
to accomplish. I am deeply grieved to find that these justices
can, after all, be mere politicians&mdash;no better than the least
patriotic of the tribe. I regret sincerely that your labor of
the last four months has met with such a result, but my
confidence in your patriotism is such that I am very sure
that, so far as personal considerations are concerned, you will
feel the disappointment far less than your friends do for you.</p>

<p>"You will not consider it a liberty if I congratulate you&mdash;or
rather the party&mdash;upon the dignified and high-toned
course you have pursued in the midst of the difficulties surrounding

<p>"I am sure that we agree in the belief that the worst
feature of this memorable business is that open fraud should
be triumphant, and that through such means the control of
a corrupt party should again be fastened upon our country.
I do not know that I am capable of judging dispassionately
of the future, but it now appears to me that that future is
black indeed, when another than yourself&mdash;the honestly
elected&mdash;holds to-day the name and powers of President.</p>

HISTORY)</h3>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Boston</span>, <i>5th March, 1877</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;On this day when you <em>ought</em> to have been
the President of these United States, I seize the opportunity
to bear my testimony to the calm and dignified manner in
which you have passed through this great trial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is many years since I ceased to be a party man. Hence
I have endeavored to judge of public affairs and men rather
by their merits than by the names they take. It is a source
of gratification to me to think that I made the right choice
in the late election. I could never have been reconciled to
the elevation by the smallest aid of mine of a person, however
respectable in private life, who must forever carry upon
his brow the stamp of fraud first triumphant in American
history.</p>

<p>"No subsequent action, however meritorious, can wash
away the letters of that record.</p>

<h2>HON. ABRAM S. HEWITT TO THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC
COMMITTEE</h2>

<h3>(HIS MOTIVES IN SUPPORTING THE ELECTORAL TRIBUNAL)</h3>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Washington, D. C.</span>, <i>March 3</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;The last act of the executive committee
was the announcement to the people of the United States
that Samuel J. Tilden was elected President, and Thomas
A. Hendricks Vice-President.</p>

<p>"This announcement was followed by a scurrilous pronunciamento
from the national Republican committee, claiming
the election of Hayes and Wheeler. The power to
determine the result resided in Congress; but grave differences
of opinion, threatening the peace of the country, existed
as to the lawful methods of procedure, and the constitutional
rights, and the duties of the two Houses in the
premises. Committees were therefore raised in both Houses
to consider the question, and to confer with each other as to
legislation proper to be adopted in order to secure a declaration
of the result without confusion and public disorder.
The Senate committee had practically perfected a bill for
this purpose before the House committee met with them in
conference. This bill had received the assent and approval
of the three Democratic Senators serving on the committee.</p>

<p>"To have rejected this settlement would, necessarily, have
produced division in the Democratic party, and been fatal
to its immediate and future success. On the other hand, the
bill itself seemed to be so wisely framed in its main features,
that the judgment of the Democratic members of the House<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
committee gradually confirmed the action of the Senate committee,
and, with some changes which were deemed favorable
to the Democratic position, the Electoral bill was approved
by all the Democratic members of both committees,
and was duly reported and became a law by the vote of a
large majority of the Democratic members of both Houses,
and was approved by the general judgment of the country.</p>

<p>"The result has disappointed the hopes of every lover of
his country. By decisions abhorrent to the natural senses
of justice, all proof of fraud was ruled out, and the States
of Louisiana and Florida have been counted for Hayes, although
all fair-minded men concede that they voted for
Tilden. This grievous wrong and its authors I have denounced
on the floor of the House, and I have no hesitancy
in declaring that, for the first time in our history, the Presidency
has been awarded to a candidate who has no just title
to its honors.</p>

<p>"But he comes into office as the result of the operation of
a law which received the support of the Democratic party,
and any attempt to resist its operation would, it seems to me,
only deprive us of the support and sympathy of all conservative
and fair-minded citizens.</p>

<p>"Inasmuch as difference of opinion exist in regard to the
policy which has been pursued by the Democratic party since
the election, and prior to the meeting of Congress, I have
only to say that so far as my action is concerned, whatever
has been done has received the approval of the executive
committee and of the only persons outside of their number
who had any right to be consulted.</p>

<p>"An absurd statement has been widely circulated that
had declared that 'I preferred the inauguration of Hayes to
the shedding of a single drop of blood.' A leading Democratic
journalist, who could at any time from his position as
a member of the House of Representatives, have ascertained
the truth, has circulated this false statement in a letter over
his own initials, although it ought to have been known to
him that I had contradicted it in a card, widely copied, immediately
after its publication. The only remark which I
ever made on this subject was in private conversation, not intended
to be repeated, and was to the effect that 'I would
prefer four years of Hayes' administration to four years
of civil war'; and upon this declaration I am willing to
stand, because four years of civil war would, in my opinion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
utterly destroy constitutional government for this generation
at least.</p>

<p>"It has also been insinuated that my course has been affected
by the ownership of a large amount of United States
bonds. It is enough for me to express the regret that I am
not so fortunate as to own any of these desirable securities,
and to state that all my means are, as they always have been,
used in giving employment to the working-men of this land,
suffering so severely from the maladministration of its public
affairs.</p>

<p>"I have also been censured for assenting to the completion
of the count in accordance with the provisions of the
law which I helped to frame, and which received my cordial
approval and my vote. As an honorable man, I do not see
that any other course was open to me, but if honor had permitted
otherwise, my judgment is that it was the wisest
course for the country, as well as for the Democratic party,
to proceed in accordance with the law to the orderly completion
of the count, although we knew that it would result in
the installation of Hayes into an office to which he had no
honest right, except such as might be deprived from the unjust
decisions of a tribunal which we had helped to create.
My reasons for this conclusion are as follows: If the count
had been defeated, and the bill to provide for a vacancy in
the office of President had become a law, a new election
would have taken place in November next: meanwhile the
office of President would have been filled by a Republican
chosen by the Senate. The whole power of the administration
would therefore be under the control of the Republican
managers. In order to succeed they must hold on to South
Carolina and Louisiana, which would necessarily involve
sustaining by force the usurping governments of Chamberlain
and Packard, with all their unlawful excrescences in
the way of unscrupulous returning boards. The patience
of the people of these two unhappy States is utterly exhausted.
They would break out in open rebellion against a government
thus forced on them, and continued in power by the
armed forces of the United States. Civil war would result.
The Federal government would re-enforce itself with all the
troops at its command; the other Southern States would
naturally rush to the aid of their suffering sister States; the
safety of the colored as well as the white population would
be endangered; and a call would be made for volunteers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
militia from the Northern States to suppress the rebellion,
and thus the flames of civil war would be lighted all over the
Union, in the midst of which a free election would be impossible,
and a military despotism take the place of civil
government. This generation would pass away before the
country would recover from the disastrous consequences of
such a fratricidal strife.</p>

<p>"In comparison with the evils of anarchy, or of a government
of force, which alone could prevent anarchy, four
years of usurpation&mdash;but usurpation in accordance with the
forms of law&mdash;seemed to me by far the lesser evil. Besides,
we have not yet tested the judgment of the people as to the
great outrage upon all justice and right which has been perpetrated.
There is no reason to suppose that it will be sanctioned
by the popular voice, but if it should be we could not
hope to save them from usurpation and despotism by force
used against the judgment of a majority of the people.</p>

<p>"To me, therefore, on the one side was anarchy and civil
war, inevitable and disastrous of all the hopes of free government;
on the other side was peace and order, with free
speech, a free press, and the ballot-box still preserved to us.</p>

<p>"Under the circumstances, I could not hesitate as to my
course. I felt that, as a patriot and a trusted servant of the
Democracy, no other course was left open to me, and I feel
sure that its wisdom will be indicated by the early and triumphant
success of the Democratic party, standing, as it
does, upon the rock of justice and patriotism, from which
no amount of passion or provocation has been able to
move it.</p>

<p>"For myself, I feel that I have now completed the duty
which was assigned to me at St. Louis. The result of the
campaign was the unquestionable election of our candidates.
That they and the people have been defrauded of their rights
is true, but for this result I do not hold myself any more
responsible than any other member of Congress upon whom
rested the duty of counting and declaring the votes.</p>

<p>"In the course of my very brief public experience, I have
already found that my usefulness as a Representative in
Congress has been seriously impaired by my position as
chairman of this committee, and I had long since determined
to ask to be permitted to retire from it as soon as the result
of the election was definitely ascertained. The unforeseen
complications which arose have necessarily compelled me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
postpone the execution of this intention until the present
time. Now, however, that all impediments to my retirement
are removed, I beg to be released from further service as
your chairman, and, thanking you for the honor you have
conferred and for the confidence which you have uniformly
manifested in my efforts to promote the success of Democratic
principles, I have the honor to be,</p>

<h2>WHAT GRANT THOUGHT OF IT</h2>

<h3>[<i>From the New York "Sun," March 7, 1877.</i>]</h3>

<p>"There are some interesting facts connected with the
Louisiana election which it does not seem necessary to keep
secret any longer.</p>

<p>"When Mr. Hewitt had his celebrated interview with
President Grant on the 3d of December last, just before the
beginning of the recent session of Congress and before the
Returning Board of Louisiana made its final declaration, the
President said that in his opinion there had been no fair
election in that State, and that the electoral votes of Louisiana
ought not to be counted at all upon either side.</p>

<p>"'But,' asked the President, 'are you going to buy the
Returning Board?' Mr. Hewitt assured him that the Democrats
had no such purpose; that they would not buy the
Presidency.</p>

<p>"Grant knew that the Returning Board and the Presidential
election were for sale because Wells' agent had told him
so; and it was natural for a man of his cast of mind to suppose
that where the office of President was to be sold for
money there would be an active competition for the purchase."</p>


<h2>SENATOR FRANCIS KERNAN TO TILDEN</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, <i>March 12th, 1877</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I expected to get over to New York and
have a chat with you last week, and hence did not write you.
Moreover, I was not in a frame of mind to write, and am not
yet. We have been wronged out of the fruits of the last
Presidential election. You were clearly and fairly elected
by the people, and Hayes has been counted in. This is hard
to bear patiently, and the mass of our party feel deeply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
aggrieved&mdash;indeed, they are so disappointed and irritated
that a great many of them are disposed to find fault with
what was done, and to believe that something more successful
could have been devised. Notwithstanding my disappointment
at the decisions of the commission, I am of the
opinion that from the standpoint we judged and voted when
we supported the bill creating the commission, we acted
patriotically and wisely&mdash;unless the two Houses came to
some arrangement as to 'counting' the electoral votes; it
looked then as though they would disagree and come to a
dead-lock; and the result would have been that the Senate
would, under some form of proceeding, have declared Hayes
and Wheeler elected; the House would have declared there
was no election by electoral votes, and would have elected
you President, and opponents were in possession and would
have sustained Hayes and Wheeler, and civil war would
probably have been the result. This would have entailed
great evils on the mass of the people, and might have destroyed
the government it was intended to preserve. My
judgment was and is that what seemed then a reasonably
fair tribunal to decide the question involved, was better than
the risk of evil to our people and our system of government.
Civil war is the last remedy of a people for political wrongs,
and should not be inaugurated till every peaceful remedy has
failed. But I will write no more on this subject; when we
meet, I shall want to talk the matter over fully.</p>

<p>"I think we shall get away from here the last of this week
or early next. The new administration will try to win popular
favor and turn attention from the title by which it came
to power by good conduct. I believe it means to reform
some of the graver abuses which marked the administration
under General Grant. I hope it will succeed in doing so.
The country needs peace, and to end self-government at the
South, and honesty and economy everywhere. I am not
very sanguine, but I hope for the best.</p>

<h2>LOUISE LIVINGSTON HUNT TO TILDEN</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Montgomery Place</span>, <i>May 4th, 1877</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Tilden</span>,&mdash;I did not go to New Orleans after
all, but I have just had a letter from there of which I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
I must copy a few lines to send you, because they are so full
of genuine heart-felt enthusiasm for yourself. They are
from my brother&mdash;who, I think I told you, first mentioned
at our own table here his conviction that you would and
ought to be candidate for the Presidency. I had written him
recently an account of the three cheers for Louisiana given
by Mr. Hewitt's guests in New York on the day of the withdrawal
of the troops. Mr. Bayard told me all about it, and
I was touched to the heart at the generous feeling that
prompted the cheers from the defeated Democrats&mdash;and their
<em>great leader</em>. I mentioned the circumstance in writing to
my brother, and here is his answer. 'I read with much
pleasure your account of the entertainment where Mr. Tilden
was present. The fact is I have felt so strongly his merit,
his services, and his patriotism that I want him to be next
President. I was, in the beginning, of the first among his
friends, and I remain, after the dread experience of the past,
where I commenced. Sometimes I am puzzled to think he
did not favor an uprising of the people to seat him. <em>I did!</em>
Was it because he was wiser that he did not speak when he
might have said, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"Vous qui m'aimez suivez moi!"</i> I hope
so.' 'Yes,' he goes on to say, 'God be praised&mdash;the men
who have so long oppressed Louisiana are gone. Once more
the State breathes free, and, filled with hope of the future,
trusts to be again happy and prosperous.'</p>

<p>"I know that these sentiments will not be read by you
with indifference, although from one you know not at all.</p>

<p>"I am, as you see by my date, in this spot, which I have
loved so dearly from infancy. The snow-storm in the far
West has made it cold, but the air is sweet with the fragrance
of early spring. The events of each day is the newspaper,
and how dull the papers seem after the excitement of the
past year. Can't you stir up the elements again? If I
dared I could point the way, but perhaps you think women
know nothing of politics and would not heed the Sybil!</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. President</span>,&mdash;I write to remind you, before
you contract any engagements elsewhere, of your promise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
to pass here so much of the summer as may be agreeable

few days ago from Judge Field, that the suggestion of which
you spoke to Judge Clifford of a submission of the electoral
vote to a more impartial tribunal than the Supreme Court,
after the recent action of some of its members present, is
seriously entertained with a hope of success, and I cannot but
flatter myself that Blaine and his adherents, in order to
divert the patronage from Hayes to be used against him in
1880, may be willing for such a change in the law of <i>Quo
Warranto</i> as, through the action of Florida and Louisiana,
may enable you to assume the title, with which I have ventured

<h2>THE NEW YORK "WORLD" AND JOHN BIGELOW (1877)</h2>

<p>"A correspondent of the <cite>World</cite> called upon Mr. Bigelow
at his residence at Highland Falls yesterday, and in the
course of his visit the following conversation took place:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Reporter.</span> Mr. Bigelow, I understand that you prepared
the volume published by the Appletons, in December,
1877, called the <cite>Presidential Counts</cite>, and particularly the
analytical introduction prefixed to it, containing what was
deemed to be at the time a semi-official Democratic view
of the precedents and practice of the government applicable
to the counting of the Presidential vote. Also that you were
in frequent communication with Mr. Tilden, and in complete
possession of his views and purposes during that
crisis.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Bigelow.</span> You are correctly informed, so far as
that publication is concerned.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Reporter.</span> You doubtless read the story related recently
by Mr. Mines in the <cite>World</cite>, and derived by him from
General Woodford.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Bigelow.</span> I saw that publication, and glanced over
its contents.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Reporter.</span> The <cite>World</cite> would like to know whether at
any time under the then existing facts of the case, Mr. Tilden
entertained any purpose of taking the oath of office as
President of the United States?</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Bigelow.</span> That question seems to me to have been
fully answered by the analytical introduction about which
you have inquired, and which in its general scope&mdash;though,
of course, not in every detail nor in its particular expressions&mdash;may
be supposed to represent the doctrines entertained by
Mr. Tilden in common with the most eminent jurists and
statesmen of the country. I do not undertake to speak for
Mr. Tilden, or in any peculiar sense as his representative, but
the very nature of the views expounded in the analytical
introduction necessarily defined the cases in which it would
have been lawful and proper for Mr. Tilden to have taken
the oath of office as President, and by inevitable implication
the cases in which it would have been unlawful and improper
for him to have done so.</p>

<p>"There were two contingencies in which it would have
been lawful and obligatory on Mr. Tilden to have taken the
official oath as President:</p>

<p>"<i>First.</i> If Congress had performed its constitutional
duty of counting the electoral votes, and had declared that
Mr. Tilden was chosen by the electoral colleges.</p>

<p>"The two Houses of Congress have all the powers of
verification of the electoral votes which the Constitution or
the laws supply or allow. Nobody else in the Federal government
has any such powers. This exclusive jurisdiction
of the two Houses has been exercised without interruption
from the beginning of the government. It is known to all
those who come in contact with Mr. Tilden at this period
that he concurred in this view of the powers and duties of the
two Houses of Congress themselves to count the electoral
vote. He was perfectly free and unreserving in the expression
of his opinions on this subject.</p>

<p>"This contingency, however, never presented itself. Congress,
before the time fixed by the law for counting the
electoral votes, passed the Election bill wherein they substantially
abdicated their powers, and enacted that the electoral
commission should in the first instance make a count,
and that its count should stand, unless overruled by the concurrent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
action of the two Houses. The electoral tribunal
counted Mr. Tilden out, and counted in a man who was not
elected. Congress did not overrule their count; consequently,
the false count stood as law under the act of Congress.</p>

<p>"<i>Secondly.</i> The other contingency in which it would
have been lawful and obligatory on Mr. Tilden to have taken
the oath of office was, that the House of Representatives on
the failure of a choice of President by the electoral colleges
had itself proceeded to make the election, voting by States
in the manner prescribed by the Constitution.</p>

<p>"This contingency, like the first one, never occurred.</p>

<p>"The House of Representatives has by the express language
of the Constitution, jurisdiction, if no person has a
majority of the electoral votes, to make the election itself.</p>

<p>"The right of the two Houses to count the electoral votes,
and to declare that any person has a majority, is a matter of
implication, precedent, and practice. But the right of the
House of Representatives to supply the failure of a choice
is a matter of positive and express constitutional provision.
It is not only a right, but a duty. The provision is mandatory.
The House is a witness in the opening of the certificates.
It is an actor in counting the votes by its own
tellers and in its presence.</p>

<p>"Having such means of knowledge as to the facts, enabling
it to ascertain whether a choice has been made by the
electoral colleges, it is also expressly vested with a power
and duty to act exclusively and conclusively in the event
that no person be found to have been chosen by a majority
of the votes of those colleges. The House acquires jurisdiction
by the fact specified in the Constitution. The assent
of the Senate to the existence of that fact is nowhere prescribed
or required. No judgment, certification, or act of
any official body is interposed as a condition to the assuming
of its jurisdiction by the House. When the House has once
acted in such a case, no review of its action nor any appeal
from its decision is provided for in the Constitution. It is
difficult to see why the House in such a case, like all tribunals
of original jurisdiction and subject to no appeal, is not the
exclusive judge of the fact and the law on which its jurisdiction
rests. It was the fear that the Senate might lead a
resistance to the rightful judgment of the House, and that
General Grant would sustain this revolutionary policy with
the army and navy and the militia of the great States in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
which the Republicans had possession of the State Governments
that deterred the assertion of the rights of the House
of Representatives, and induced its vote for and acquiescence
in the electoral commission.</p>

<p>"But without speculating upon causes or motives, one
thing is certain. The House of Representatives did not
elect Mr. Tilden in the manner prescribed by the Constitution.
On the other hand, it did concur with the Senate in
anticipating and preventing the contingency in which it
might have had to act, and in providing beforehand an expedient
which was to make its own action in supplying the
failure of an election by the colleges impossible. It adopted
the electoral law and went through all the forms of the electoral
scheme. True, it afterwards passed a declaratory
resolution condemning the action of the electoral commission,
and asserting that Mr. Tilden had been duly elected. But
the Constitution had not provided that a man should or
could take office as President on a declaratory resolution of
the House of Representatives. If that resolution could have
had full effect to abrogate the electoral law which the House
had assisted to enact it would have still been a nullity as an
exercise of the constitutional power of the House to elect.
It created no warrant of authority to Mr. Tilden to take
the oath of office.</p>

<p>"I have been somewhat long in answering your question,
because the matter is one of importance. I might have disposed
of your question more briefly by simply saying that no
contingency provided by the Constitution ever existed in
which Mr. Tilden could lawfully or properly take the oath of
office as President. The idea that Mr. Tilden ever thought
of taking the oath of office illegally is, in my judgment, quite
as preposterous as is the other idea that he would have
omitted to take it if any contingency had arisen in which it
was his right or duty to take it, or that any menace would
have had the slightest influence in preventing his performing
his whole obligations to the people. I will venture to say
that if it had been his right and duty to take the oath, he
would not have done so at the City Hall in New York surrounded
by the forces which, according to Mr. Mines, General
Woodford pictured to his imagination, but at the Federal
capital, even though he had known that he would be kidnapped
or subjected to a drum-head court martial five minutes
afterwards. It is doubtless true that revolutionary ideas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
were entertained by the hierarchy of office-holders in possession
of the government. General Grant did utter menaces
in published interviews, and did make a display of military
force in Washington to overawe Congress. I presume this
was a part of the system of intimidation for which he allowed
himself to be used by the office-holders and which was intended
to act upon public opinion through the fear of disturbance
as well as upon Congress. But it is safe to say that
whatever other effects they produced they did not prevent
Mr. Tilden from taking the oath of office, which he never
had any lawful authority to take, in the absence of such
action on the part of the House of Representatives as would
have fulfilled the conditions prescribed by the Constitution.
The fear that he would do so, inducing the Republicans to
swear their candidate into office privately on the Saturday
previous to the commencement of the term of office besides
repeating the ceremony at the inauguration, was born of a
consciousness that causes the wicked to flee when no man
pursueth. I was aware that about that time Mr. Tilden's
home was besieged by emissaries of the press and the telegraph
to know if the rumors to that effect which prevailed
in Washington were true. This was a species of curiosity
which, I believe, Mr. Tilden did not consider it any part of
his duty to relieve."</p>


<h2>A TALK WITH MR. TILDEN</h2>

<h3>[<i>From a Special Correspondent of the "World," July 17, 18&mdash;</i>]</h3>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Sea Girt, N. J.</span>, <i>July 16</i>.
</p>

<p>"Governor Tilden, as some time ago announced in the
<cite>World</cite>, will sail in the Cunard steamer <i>Scythia</i> Wednesday,
and is to be accompanied by Secretary of State Bigelow.
The trip is purely for recreation, and the travellers will not
return until the middle of October. Mr. Tilden, therefore,
will be absent from the country and State during what is
expected to be the interesting fall campaign. The fact that
Mr. Bigelow is to accompany him will perhaps satisfy the
politicians and set at rest the question of his renomination as
Secretary of State. I have learned while here, authoritatively,
that Mr. Bigelow is not and will not be a candidate before
the approaching State convention of New York for a renomination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Tilden is looking remarkably well, and declares himself
to be very much improved in health by his sojourn at
this pleasant resort. He said to me that his trip has no
connection whatever with any business enterprise or railroad
scheme, as has been announced without authority in some of
the papers. As to the events which have happened since the
Presidential election and the numerous wild rumors circulated
in reference to his political intentions, Mr. Tilden
talked very freely. In regard to the electoral commission,
he said that he had never had any real confidence in the
arbitration of a question where there was so much at stake
by a body of that kind. That settlement, he said, involved
not only the Presidency, but all the patronage and power of
the Federal administration, together with all the schemes,
plans, and jobs connected with it. The Republican party
and the men who had managed it in the past were too anxious
to retain the administration to yield any point in an arbitration.
The result of the electoral commission, therefore, was
what might have been expected considering the power and
influence brought to bear upon the political majority of that
body as finally constituted.</p>

<p>He furthermore never liked the scheme as a matter of
principle, believing that the true direction of a Democratic
appeal was not away from 369 representatives of the people
towards fifteen individuals, and still less from fifteen individuals
towards one to be selected necessarily with a large
element of chance, not to say of trick and device. He thought
there should rather have been an appeal from the 369 representatives
to the 8,000,000 of voters through a new election.
He was distrustful of the secrecy, celerity, and improvidence
with which the arrangement was carried through and ushered
into being. But the proposition appealed to the hopes of the
business classes, which were anxious above all things for a
settlement of almost any kind, at almost any price, and as
it was presented by the unanimous report of the joint committee,
it become the representative, and the only representative,
of the public desire for peace.</p>

<p>"The events which are now attracting so much public attention
in New Orleans and the disclosures which, perhaps,
may follow, Mr. Tilden seemed to consider only as the logical
outcome of the revolutionary acts of last fall and winter.
'In a government like ours,' he said, 'such fraudulent practices
as were reported from New Orleans last November<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>
sooner or later must come to the light, and the guilty parties
with their practices must be made known. It was so with
the ring frauds in New York; it has been the case to a certain
extent in Washington, and a like result will follow in
New Orleans. It is against the natural course of events that
deeds of this kind should ultimately fail of being brought
to light in all their enormities.' All this was said with
philosophic calmness and without any heat whatever.</p>

<p>"In regard to his own political future, Mr. Tilden had
nothing to say except that he could not see any possible contingency
which could induce him to be a candidate for or
to seek an election to a seat in the United States Senate.
He felt entirely confident of the success of the Democratic
party this fall in all the large central States, and especially
in New York, by a very large majority, believing that events
were all pointing in that direction. To the charge that he has
been seeking to control the nominations of the next Democratic
State convention of New York, he gave a direct denial,
and added that he thought it unwise to interfere in any
way as between the numerous friends who are seeking position
on the State ticket. His absence abroad during the time
for holding the convention and selecting the delegates would,
he said, preclude any interference on his part. He thought,
however, that the drift of public sentiment was towards a new
ticket altogether, with none of the present incumbents upon
it. He hoped that the ticket would be so made up as to be
recognized as thoroughly able, strong, and upright. He appeared
to be specially anxious that the Democracy should
secure a majority in the next State Senate, in order that
the evils which have been brought about by Republican control
of that body might be corrected.</p>

<p class="sig">
H. C."
</p>

<p>Mr. Tilden spent the summer of 1877 in Europe. On
his return he was serenaded by the Young Men's Democratic
Club, on which occasion he made a brief speech, in the course
of which he said, according to the New York <cite>Tribune</cite> of
October 26, 1877:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The increase of power in the Federal government during
the last twenty years, the creation of a vast office-holding
class, with its numerous dependents, and the growth of the
means of corrupt influence, have well nigh destroyed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>
balance of our complex system. It was my judgment in
1876 that public opinion, demanding a change of administration,
needed to embrace two-thirds of the people at the beginning
of the canvass, in order to cast a majority of the
votes at the election. If this tendency is not arrested its
inevitable result will be the practical destruction of our system.
Let the Federal government grasp power over the
great corporations of our country and acquire the means of
addressing their interests and their fears; let it take jurisdiction
of riots which it is the duty of the State to suppress;
let it find pretexts for increasing the army, and soon those
in possession of the government will have a power with which
no opposition can successfully compete. The experience of
France under the Third Napoleon shows that, with elective
forms and universal suffrage, despotism can be established
and maintained. In the canvass of 1876 the Federal government
embarked in the contest with unscrupulous activity.
A member of the Cabinet was the head of a partisan committee.
Agents stood at the doors of the pay offices to exact
contributions from official subordinates. The whole office-holding
class were made to exhaust their power. Even the
army, for the first time, to the disgust of the soldiers and
many of the officers, was moved about the country as an
electioneering instrument. All this was done under the eye
of the beneficiary of it, who was making the air vocal with
professions of civil service reform, to be begun after he had
himself exhausted all the immoral advantages of civil service
abuses. Public opinion in some States was overdone by
corrupt influences and by fraud. But so strong was the desire
for reform that the Democratic candidates received
4,300,000 suffrages. This was a majority of the popular
vote of about 300,000, and of 1,250,000 of the white citizens.
It was a vote of 700,000 larger than General Grant received
in 1872, and 1,300,000 larger than he received in 1868.
For all that, the rightfully elected candidates of the Democratic
party were counted out, and a great fraud triumphed,
which the American people have not condoned and will never
condone. [Prolonged applause and cheers.] Yes, the crime
will never be condoned, and it never should be. I do not
denounce the fraud as affecting my personal interests, but
because it stabbed the very foundations of free government.
[Loud cheers.] I swear in the presence of you all, and I
call upon you to bear witness to the oath, to watch, during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>
the remainder of my life, over the rights of the citizens of
our country with a jealous care. Such a usurpation must
never occur again, and I call upon you to unite with me in
the defence of our sacred and precious inheritance. The
government of the people must not be suffered to become only
an empty name." [Loud applause.]</p>

<p>The remainder of Mr. Tilden's address was as follows:</p>

<p>"The step, from an extreme degree of corrupt abuses in
the elections to a subversion of the elective system itself,
is natural. No sooner was the election over than the whole
power of the office-holding class, led by a Cabinet minister,
was exhorted to procure, and did procure, from the State
canvassers of two States, illegal and fraudulent certificates,
which were made a pretext for a false count of the electoral
votes. To enable these officers to exercise the immoral courage
necessary to the parts assigned to them, and to relieve
them from the timidity which God has implanted in the human
bosom as a limit to criminal audacity, detachments
of the army were sent to afford them shelter. The expedients
by which the votes of the electors chosen by the people of these
two States were rejected, and the votes of the electors having
the illegal and fraudulent certificates were counted, and the
menace of usurpation by the President of the Senate of
dictatorial power over all the questions in controversy, and
the menace of the enforcement of his pretended authority
by the army and navy, the terrorism of the business classes
and the kindred measures by which the false count was consummated,
are known. The result is the establishment of a
precedent destructive of our whole elective system. [Applause.]
The temptation to those in possession of the government
to perpetuate their own power by similar methods
will always exist, and if the example shall be sanctioned by
success, the succession of government in this country will
come to be determined by fraud or force, as it has been in
almost every other country; and the experience will be reproduced
here which has led to the general adoption of the
hereditary system in order to avoid confusion and civil war.
The magnitude of a political crime must be measured by its
natural and necessary consequences. Our great Republic
has been the only example in the world of a regular and orderly
transfer of governmental succession by the elective
system. To destroy the habit of traditionary respect for the
will of the people, as declared through the electoral forms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>
and to exhibit our institutions as a failure, is the greatest
possible wrong to our own country. It is also a heavy blow
to the hopes of patriots struggling to establish self-government
in other countries. It is a greater crime against mankind
than the usurpation of December 2, 1851, depicted
by the illustrious pen of Victor Hugo. The American people
will not condone it under any pretext or for any purpose.
[Cheers.] Young men! in the order of nature, we who have
guarded the sacred traditions of our free government will
soon leave that work to you. Within the life of most who
hear me, the Republic will embrace 100,000,000 of people.
Whether its institutions shall be preserved in substance and
in spirit, as well as in barren forms, and will continue to
be a blessing to the toiling millions here and a good example
to mankind, now everywhere seeking a larger share in the
management of their own affairs, will depend on you. Will
you accomplish that duty and mark these wrong-doers of
1876, with the indignation of a betrayed, wronged, and sacrificed
people? [A voice&mdash;'You bet we will.' Laughter.]
I have no personal feeling, but thinking how surely that
example will be followed if condoned, I can do no better than
to stand among you, and do battle for the maintenance of
free government. I avail myself of the occasion to thank
you, and to thank all in our State and country who have accorded
to me their support, not personal to myself, but for the
cause I have represented, and which has embraced the largest
and holiest interests of humanity." [Continued applause.]</p></blockquote>

<h2>DOCUMENTS REFERRED TO IN JUDGE FIELD'S LETTER</h2>

<h3>[<i>Justice Bradley to the Newark "Daily Advertiser" and the
Electoral Commission.</i>]</h3>

<p>The <cite>Sun</cite> gives Bradley's letter in full as follows:</p>

<p class="sig">
"'<span class="smcap">Stowe, Vt.</span>, <i>September 6</i>.</p>

<p>
"'<span class="smcap">Editor "Advertiser.</span>"
</p>

<p>"'<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I perceive the New York <cite>Sun</cite> has reiterated its
charge that after preparing a written opinion in favor of
the Tilden electors in the Florida case and submitting it to
the electoral commission, I changed my views during the
night preceding the vote in consequence of the pressure
brought to bear upon me by Republican politicians and the
Pacific Railroad men, whose carriages, it is said, surrounded
my house during the evening. This, I believe, is the important
point of the charge. Whether I wrote one opinion
or twenty in my private examination of the subject, is of
little consequence and of no concern to anybody. The opinion
which I finally gave was the result of my deliberations without
influence from outside parties. The above slander was
published some time since, but I never saw it until recently,
and deemed it too absurd to need refutation. But as it is
categorically repeated, perhaps I ought to notice it. The
same story about the carriages of leading Republicans and
others congregating about my house was circulated in Washington
at one time, and came to the ears of my family only
to raise a smile of contempt. The whole thing is a falsehood.
Not one visitor called at my house that evening, and
during the whole sitting of the commission I had no private
discussion whatever of the subjects at issue with any person
interested on the Republican side, and but few words with
any persons. Indeed, I zealously sought to avoid all discussion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
outside the commission itself. The allegation that
I read my opinion to Judges Clifford and Field is entirely
untrue. I read no opinion to either of them, and have no
recollection of expressing one; if I did, it could only have
been suggestively, or in a hypothetical manner, and not for
committal of my final judgment or action. The question
was one of great importance to me, of much difficulty and
embarrassment. I earnestly endeavored to come to a right
decision, free from all political or extraneous considerations.
In my private examination of the principal question, about
going behind the returns, I wrote and rewrote the arguments
and considerations on both sides as they occurred to me,
sometimes being inclined to one view of the subject and
sometimes to the other, but finally I threw aside these lucubrations,
and as you have rightly stated, wrote out a short
opinion, which I read in the Florida case during the sitting
of the commission. This decision expresses the conviction
to which I had arrived, and which after a full consideration
of the whole subject seemed to me a satisfactory solution of
the questions; and I may say that the more I have reflected
since, the more satisfied have I become that it was right.
At all events, it was the result of my own reflections and consideration,
without any suggestions from any quarter, except
the arguments adduced by counsel in the public discussion
and by members of the commission in private consultation.
As for the insinuation contained in a recent article published
in a prominent periodical by a noted politician, implying
that the case was decided in consequence of political conspiracy,
I can only say that from the peculiar position I occupied
on the commission I am able positively to say that it
is utterly devoid of truth, at least, so far as the action of
the commission itself was concerned. In that article the
writer couples my name with the names of those whom he
supposes are obnoxious to the public odium. The decencies
of public expression, if nothing more, might well have deterred
so able a writer from making personal imputations which
he did not know to be well founded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span></p>


<h2>"JUDGE BRADLEY HEARD FROM</h2>

<p>"An explanation has at last been offered in behalf of Judge
Bradley respecting his alleged misconduct as a member of
the electoral commission. It is found in the columns of the
Newark <cite>Daily Advertiser</cite>, a journal with which he is known
to maintain relations of unusual intimacy, and is in the following
language:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'It is just as well that the full fact should be known as
a matter of history. Judge Bradley had already decided, in
the Florida case, that he could not go behind the returns of
the State officials. In the Louisiana case, he finally, and,
after anxious thought, held to the same opinion, but of two
sets of returns he chose the one he thought most authentic
and legal. That elected Hayes. As to the doubt whether
Judge Bradley could have prepared a written opinion on
one side while he was expressing different opinions orally
on the other, the facts are worth telling, and we dare to assert
them without any other authorization than our challenge
that they cannot be contradicted. The morning before the
opinion was given, Senator Edmunds had guessed out Judge
Bradley's decision, but he did not know it. Up to that time,
as we understand, the opinions delivered had been oral.
There may have been one or two exceptions. At the session
next day, Senator Edmunds whispered to Judge Bradley that
as the opinion he was to give was to be decisive, it ought to
be in writing. The argument had not then closed. Bradley
accepted the suggestion, and, sitting at his place, dashed
down the decision on paper within an hour, in the presence
and during the debate of his colleagues. He was subsequently
urged to enlarge the argument, but it stands in the
printed report just as it was then written. And therefore
Judge Field is very correct in saying that Judge Bradley
did not, at any time before, "read" to him an opinion.'"</p></blockquote>


<h2>H. F. TYLDEN TO TILDEN</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Cumberland House, Chilham, N. Canterbury</span>,
<i>26th March</i> (<i>1878?</i>).<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Governor</span>,&mdash;I sent you the fly-leaf of an old
Bible, in my possession, the year after you left England.
It was scribbled over with the word 'Catts' in different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
places, and had the names of several Tyldens&mdash;John, Richard,
and Henry and a Mary. The Bible was published in
1559. I was sent the accompanying rude verse, which is
supposed, in the last line, to refer to the change in the spelling
of the name Tylden, and Catts is again mentioned, as
if it were the home from which the Tyldens said 'Good-by'
when they were going across the water. I have painted
the writing over, as it was so indistinct. A man living in
Ashford had it in an old receipt-book. I wonder if that
house we went to see near Tenterden could have been Catts?
There is a farm called Cat's Farm quite close here, but I
don't think it can be the one alluded to, though Sir John
Fagge, whose palace adjoins Chilham Park originally spelt
the name Fogge (or rather his ancestors did), and evidently
the book of receipts originally belonged to some one of that
name. We hope your party arrived quite safely in New
York. Some day I shall ask you to send me all their photographs,
as we wish to get all the Tildens and Tyldens in a
book together.</p>

<p>"Katie was thought like one of your nieces by some of the
people here who saw them walk up the village. I don't
know which it was. Dick is still quartered at Woolwich;
he was at home for three weeks lately, and Katie much enjoyed
riding about with him. We are now having a little
winter, snow falling. I am suffering from inflammation of
the eyes. The state of Ireland is a great worry to me for
many reasons. I can't tell you how we always think of you,
and wonder if we shall meet again.</p>

<p>"I should very much like to send you the Bible of which
I sent you the fly-leaf. I think it might be interesting to you.
Messrs. Morgan were your agents when you were here. I
might find out from them how to send it. Katie joins me in
love and kind remembrances to your nieces.</p>

<p>"Believe me to be, dear Governor.</p>

<h2>GENERAL WILLIAM PRESTON TO S. J. TILDEN</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Lexington, Ky.</span>, <i>30 March, 1878</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Governor</span>,&mdash;The kindness and interest you
have shown towards my son in New York are very deeply
felt by me, apart from the great aid you gave him in commencing
his life in an untried field. Through your influence
he has commenced his career under excellent auspices, but
I can readily discern from our correspondence that the social
and fashionable attractions of the city can have left
him but little time for reading and work. This he tells me
very frankly in his letters, but I have indulged in no long
admonitions or remonstrances, because you must give a
young horse head sometimes to keep him to the course. As
I know you have equestrian tastes, you must pardon my illustration.
But whilst I observe this plan, I do not wish my
son to run with a loose rein nor swerve from the course. I
know he has honor, truth, and courage, and I hope he will
be a true gentleman and useful citizen in after life. Although
wealth and distinction in the intellectual world are
desirable, they are not, to my mind, paramount objects. I
was brought up with old-fashioned ideas that honest military
renown and oratorical distinction were first, and rather inclined
to the thought '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ratio ab oratio sunt arma hominis
acutiora ferro</i>,' but it seems that taste is not hereditary; or,
at least, I fear it is not. The course he is pursuing is rather
in obedience to my own advice than his inclinations.</p>

<p>"But I sat down to write only a few lines of thanks to
you, and I am trespassing on your time. Wickliffe writes
me that he will be with you, or at your house, on Monday, and
if you can write me a few lines so that I may know how he
is getting along in New York, you would confer upon me a
great personal favor.</p>

<p>"I pray you to present my kind remembrances to your
sister Mrs. Pelton and to the ladies, and to believe me.</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">23 Park Ave.</span>, <i>April 4, 1878</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Governor</span>,&mdash;I want you to advise me in a matter
which interests you, since you have promised to come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span>
my dinner to Bayard Taylor at the Union League Club on
the evening of the 10th inst. I invited Mr. O'Conor, and
am sure, from the tone of his reply, that he would like to
come. He declines, however, basing the refusal on the belief
that I cannot, and ought not, keep the entertainment private,
and that he is anxious for the remainder of his days to avoid
any agency in public displays.</p>

<p>"You know him so well that you can tell me in a word
whether it would be discreet for me to write again endeavoring
to remove his objection. The dinner is to be limited to
about twenty (the table will only seat twenty-five), and I
am not going, under any circumstances, to admit any reporter.
It will be absolutely as private as it is ever possible
to have anything of this sort.</p>

<p>"Mr. O'Conor's letter is so evidently sincere in tone, and
I have been so desirous, anyway, to have him present, that
I venture to ask your advice as to whether I should try again.</p>

<p>"Forgive the bother, and believe me</p>

<h2>TILDEN TO HON. CHARLES CAREY</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">New York, Wednesday Morning</span>, <i>June 5th, 1878</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Carey</span>,&mdash;I received your telegram late last
evening, and answer by mail because the telegraph is leaky.</p>

<p>"My appreciation of Mr. Henderson has been so manifest
that I need not say how competent I deem him, or that he
may fairly be classed among those from whom a choice is to
be made.</p>

<p>"But I am totally uninformed of the views of Governor
Robinson. He may, for aught I know, have a purpose already
formed; and he is always independent and persistent.
I think it would be advisable for you to learn the situation
as fully as possible before making our friend a candidate,
whom you do not wish to expose to a failure. Perhaps you
had better go down to Albany quietly and get what information
you can. The attempts of the Republican press, when
Governor Robinson first came in, to create an impression
(utterly unfounded in fact, as everybody who knows his independent,
self-poised, and firm nature must see) that he
occupied to me a relation of dependence, was intended to
wound him and his friends, as well as to misrepresent me;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
and induced me to adopt the rule of not recommending anybody,
or anything to him, of my own motion, or unless he
had occasion to consult me, which he seldom, if ever, has any
need to do. Under that rule of delicacy and respect, I am
less advised of his ideas than might be supposed.</p>

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;In rummaging over and burning up the
documents which have accumulated through twenty years'
service, I found your old pamphlet, which gave to me many
lessons during our perilous days before and during the war.
Thinking that it might be of more interest to you now than
to one who has learned it by heart, and knowing how valuable,
after many years, are one's own thoughts for memory
and suggestion, I cannot refrain from tendering it to you&mdash;if
only for a retrospect. It may be more useful to you than
to myself.</p>

<p>"We are just closing up the long session. You will see
by my last vote, all alone from New York&mdash;though for one,
if alone&mdash;I would never consent to quiet bad title, even
though technically legal. The worst things that I have ever
known in public life have been statutory.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Hon. S. J. Tilden</span>,&mdash;I write to express to you the gratification
I have felt on reading the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">exposé</i> in this morning's
<cite>Argus</cite>, by Mr. Marble, of your opinions and course in respect
to the memorable arbitration for the Presidency. The
common sense of public opinion pointed in the same direction.
Moral courage and firmness from the start in the
House would most certainly have secured a just result.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
The perpetrators of the wicked fraud would have cowed.
If Grant's military <em>penchant</em> had brought in the use of arms,
the rash resort and its consequences would be for the other
side to answer for. But timid counsels prevailed. Your
friends consented to arbitrate whether your coat belonged
to you or to Mr. Hayes&mdash;they had, moreover, the weakness
to confide in the fair professions of the other side, so far as
to give them a majority of the arbitrators.</p>

<p>"I am glad to learn by Mr. Marble's <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">exposé</i> that you
gave no assent to the arbitration, but took your stand upon
the true legal and constitutional ground. And in this expression
I believe a great many of your friends concur.
When the decision was made, by a tribunal appointed by law,
it was too late to revolt. Concurrence was then the only
manly course.</p>

<h2>TILDEN TO THE DIRECTORS OF THE LOUISVILLE INDUSTRIAL
EXPOSITION</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <i>Aug. 25, '78</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;It would give me the greatest pleasure
if I were able to attend the exposition to which you do me
the honor to invite me.</p>

<p>"I am not a stranger to the excellence of the agricultural
industries of Kentucky. I have derived from them the favorite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span>
horses which I have used for out-of-door exercise, and
should be delighted to see the best specimens of the Kentucky
stock in the beautiful region where they were nurtured.</p>

<p>"Two months ago I returned from a brief visit of rest
and recreation to the British Isles. I brought with me a
vivid impression of the yet unappreciated value of the cereal
products of the Mississippi Valley. I felt thankful that we
have a sun in our heavens which, in the season of agricultural
growth, pours down daily floods of light and warmth, making
the earth prolific, giving abundance and variety of fruits, assuring
the wheat crop, yielding cotton in its zone, and ripening
corn everywhere, even to the verge of the farthest north.
Take, for instance, the single product of Indian corn which
forms one of the staples of Kentucky. It is the most natural
and spontaneous of our cereal products. It ought to
give in our country an annual yield of 1,500,000 bushels,
or three times the whole wheat crop. It is little inferior to
wheat in nutrition, and costs less than one-half on the seaboard
and much less than one-half on the farm. It can be
cooked by those who consent to learn how, into many delicious
forms of human food. It is the most valuable sustenance
of animal life. It ought to become the basis of an immense
traffic with the British Isles, where the scantiness and economy
of food strikes the American traveller, with the contrast
to the immense abundance and wasteful consumption of our
own people.</p>

<p>"Almost as I write, I notice a late statement that the exports
of our country for the year past have been nearly
$250,000,000 in excess of our imports. This result is mainly
due to the development of our agricultural industries.
It is a cheering indication that amid the pressure and distress
we are laying the foundation of a new and real prosperity
by the energies of our farmers.</p>

<p>"I regret that involuntary engagements render it impossible
that, on the present occasion, I should be a personal
witness of the attainments of our agricultural industries."</p>


<h2>TILDEN AND A "WORLD" REPORTER</h2>

<h3>(WHY HE DID NOT TAKE THE OATH AS PRESIDENT)</h3>

<p class="sig">
"<i>1878-9.</i>

<p>"Last Friday evening a reporter of the <cite>World</cite> visited Mr.
Tilden in his Gramercy Park mansion, and was accorded
a brief interview in the commodious and well-appointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[577]</a></span>
library of that distinguished gentleman. Mr. Tilden looked
well, and conversed with all his old-time fire and interest.</p>

<p>"'Of course, I have come to see you by instructions respecting
the story that General Woodford related to Mr.
Mines, and that the latter gentleman has related to the public
through the <cite>World</cite>.'</p>

<p>"'I have not read it through. A friend told me of its
substance this morning while I was down-town. But I am
averse to talking about these insignificant matters.'</p>

<p>"'Nothing can be insignificant, Mr. Tilden, that concerns
your relations to the Presidency or its relations to the public.
What the <cite>World</cite> mainly wishes to know is whether or
not you at any time purposed taking the oath as President.'</p>

<p>"'At any time'&mdash;musingly. 'Certainly, if the House
had declared me elected. Then I should have had a certificate&mdash;a
title. But after the electoral scheme, which I always
opposed, was complete&mdash;although advised that I might
so as to raise the question&mdash;I never for a moment entertained
the idea of taking the oath of office either in Washington
or in New York or elsewhere. It would have been
ridiculous. I have no evidence of title then&mdash;no claim&mdash;no
warrant.'</p>

<p>"'Then you do not believe General Grant intended to arrest
or detain you?'</p>

<p>"'How can I tell what General Grant intended? All I
can tell you is what I intended as the representative of the
people who, by nearly half a million majority on the popular
vote, elected me their President.'</p>

<p>"'Is there anything more in the story you would wish to
speak of?'</p>

<p>"'I have not thoroughly read it. Besides, as the pivot of
the story is my intention to challenge an issue by taking the
oath of office, is not the story substantially disposed of when
I tell you that there is no real pivot?'"</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Governor Tilden</span>,&mdash;I was very glad to find
that no obstacle presented itself in the way of your completing
the arrangement for hiring Mr. Waring's place at Yonkers,
and the prospect of numbering you and your household among
our residents is a very gratifying one to me. I have lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span>
nearly fourteen years in my little suburban home there, and
am satisfied that I have warded off serious dangers to my
own health and that of my family by the change from city
to semi-country life. I believe Yonkers to be in every respect
the most desirable suburb of New York, and I trust
you will conclude to purchase Mr. Waring's property on
which I know a vast sum has been well expended. I hired
my house when I first went to Yonkers, but in less than sixty
days bought it, in the belief that whether I remained or not
it was a safe property, and I have never regretted the purchase.</p>

<p>For some time previous to the receipt of the foregoing
note, Mr. Tilden had been encouraged by his medical advisers
to provide himself with a country home conveniently
accessible from the city, where he would secure as many
hygienic advantages from its situation as possible. He had
been assisted by Mr. Trevor, himself an old resident at
Yonkers, in selecting a property in that city which was for
sale, and bore the name destined to become famous&mdash;"Graystone."
He leased it at first, but before his lease expired
completed the purchase of it. To the original purchase, he
added several adjoining properties in subsequent years. The
cost of his purchases and improvements at Yonkers may
be stated with sufficient precision as follows, and possesses a
certain historic interest:<br /><br /></p>

<h2>JOHN BIGELOW TO HON. WILLIAM H. PECK, EX-SECRETARY
OF STATE OF MICHIGAN</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <i>Febry. 28th, 1879</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,&mdash;In your last note you ask me if
Tilden will be in the field for the Presidency in 1880.</p>

<p>"That is a question which, I presume, no one, not even
Tilden himself, could answer categorically at present. I can
express to you my own conviction, and you may take it for
what it is worth.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tilden has scarcely been in a position at any time,
since the election, to consult his own tastes or personal comfort
in this matter; if he had been, I think he would have
notified his friends immediately upon his return from Europe
in 1877 that they must look for another leader. He
forbore to take that step, because he shared the popular belief
that he was the President-elect of the United States,
and that he was thereby clothed with certain responsibilities
to his party at least, anomalous and unprecedented it is true,
but which were of the gravest character and which it was impossible
for him to put off.</p>

<p>"He was still the commander in the midst of a campaign
in which he had defeated the enemy, but had not yet realized
the fruits of victory. To leave his soldiers in the field and
in the presence of the enemy without a leader was a step
which would not stand the test of a moment's reflection.
Washington could, with equal propriety, have resigned his
command after the battle at Yorktown and delivered his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span>
sword to Cornwallis, instead of himself taking the sword of
the British general.</p>

<p>"Such a procedure on Mr. Tilden's part would have practically
disarmed the Democratic party and compelled its
surrender at discretion. What in 1877 would have been
only compromising subsequent events would now make disgraceful.
Conscious that they had come into office by criminal
processes, and that Tilden was the choice of the people,
the administration has exerted all the powers of the Federal
government in the effort to reconcile the country with this
result by defaming and maligning the character of Mr.
Tilden, and persecuting him, if possible, out of public life.</p>

<p>"In the latter purpose, they would probably have succeeded
had Mr. Tilden been a poor man, and dependent upon
his profession for his daily bread.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tilden could easily accommodate himself to the
choice of any good man for the Presidency, for it is no
vulgar ambition which has led him to accept the prominence
which his party has given him, but he cannot be expected
to make the slightest concession that involves his personal
honor. He will defend that as long as he has a drop of blood
in his body, whoever may stand by him or desert him. Of
this you may feel perfectly assured.</p>

<p>"Now, I do not see how it is possible for Tilden, under
the circumstances, to withdraw from the canvass for 1880;
and just so far as it seems impossible for him to withdraw,
it seems impossible for his party to assent to his withdrawal.</p>

<p>"There are three questions which must take precedence
of every other in the next national convention.</p>

<p>"1. Was Tilden elected by the people in 1876?</p>

<p>"2. Was Hayes counted in by corrupt and fraudulent
means?</p>

<p>"3. Has Tilden done anything since the election to forfeit
the confidence of his party or of the nation?</p>

<p>"Its answer to these three questions will exercise a controlling
influence over its final action.</p>

<p>"On the proofs already in the possession of Congress, I
venture to say that there could not be found a jury of twelve
disinterested and unbiased freeholders in the land who would
hesitate to hold&mdash;-</p>

<p>"<i>First.</i> That Tilden was elected President by the people.</p>

<p>"<i>Second.</i> That he was deprived of the office by fraud; and,</p>

<p>"<i>Third.</i> That the charges of attempting to purchase electoral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span>
votes are not only not proven, but that they are the foul
offspring of the most ruffianly and rancorous partisanship.</p>

<p>"To take another candidate in 1880 is to admit that
Tilden was never the choice either of his party or of the
country, and that he was unworthy of the support of either.
It is to sanction the base conspiracy by which the people
were defrauded of their choice. It is to lie down under the
degrading imputations by which, through Tilden, the conspirators
have sought to humiliate and demoralize his party.</p>

<p>"Can you believe for a moment that the Democratic
party is or can be reduced to such extremities?</p>

<p>"The calumnies which have been propagated against Tilden
will rather strengthen than weaken him as a candidate
if renominated. They will be fatal to any other candidate,
and for the obvious reason that any other candidate would
have to contend with the practical admission of his party
that it had presented and supported a candidate at the last
Presidential election who was unworthy of its own or the
country's confidence, and whom they had in consequence deliberately
abandoned.</p>

<p>"Such an admission would be fatal, and the more surely
fatal both because it would be an act of the most flagrant
injustice to Mr. Tilden, and because the responsibility for
such an act of political brutality would be directly traceable
to the unreasonable ambition of men whose first duty it
should be to sustain and defend him.</p>

<p>"It is, therefore, a vital necessity for the party to vindicate
itself no less than Mr. Tilden, while to desert him would
be as much more disastrous to the former as the interests
of a nation are greater than those of any individual citizen
however eminent.</p>

<p>"I do not think there are many people in the Democratic
party so dull as not to see this, or so wanting in loyalty to a
brave and successful leader as not to feel that they themselves
will have to suffer most by deserting the man who has endured
three years of unparalleled persecution rather than desert
them.</p>

<p>"To you I need not dwell upon other obvious reasons for
renominating Tilden&mdash;I need not remind you of what he
has done for the Democratic party during the last fifty years,
and especially since 1874; I need not tell you how he has
stood and stands to-day, like Saul in Israel, a head and
shoulders above all his countrymen as a statesman and party-leader;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span>
of the impossibility of our carrying his native State
for any other candidate whose nomination must of necessity
be an insult to him and to it; of the vast power and promise
treasured up in the political personality, which for several
years has enjoyed the distinction of concentrating upon itself
the hostility and malignity of all those classes and parties
which it has always been the paramount effort and duty of
the Democracy to subdue or to exterminate.</p>

<p>"Independent of these obvious, though on that account
none the less important, considerations, and looking solely
to the special questions which for the first time in our history
will confront the next national Democratic convention,
I do not see how it can hesitate to renominate Mr. Tilden
by acclamation unless he refuses to be a candidate. Nor do
I see how, under the circumstances, he can refuse to be a
candidate. I have never heard him express any determination
upon the subject, but I think it safe to presume that
if he had not intended to be a candidate again he would have
purchased the peace and repose which such an announcement
would have procured him long before this, and when such
a step was beset with fewer difficulties than at present.</p>

<p>"That I have not incorrectly interpreted the drift of public
sentiment on this subject, I send you a copy of the Albany
<cite>Argus</cite> containing five or six columns of extracts from the
leading Democratic journals of nearly every State in the
Union. They show how much more logically the people
generally are reasoning upon the subject than many who aspire
to lead them. These journals, as you will see, almost
unanimously recognize not only the expediency, but the necessity
of renominating Mr. Tilden. Yours faithfully,</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">John Bigelow</span>."</p>

<p>
"<i>Hon. William H. Peck.</i>
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The universal conviction that Mr. Tilden was going to receive
the votes of the nation for President in 1876 compelled
Mr. Hayes, or his official dependents in Washington, to begin,
in the fall of that year, a campaign of defamation
against the one who promised to become General Grant's inevitable
successor.</p>

<p>Mr. Tilden's public services and character, and the expressions
of popular favor with which the press was teeming,
left the administration no resource but calumny.</p>

<p>The prosperity which he had enjoyed in the prosecution of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span>
his profession during the years succeeding the election of
Mr. Lincoln to the Presidency inspired the suspicion that he
had become a man of far greater wealth than he had yet
realized; and through the control which the administration
could exert over the machinery of the Federal courts, they
hit upon the device of charging him with giving false reports
of his income to their officers.</p>

<p>Without any proof except their corrupt suspicions, they
directed the United States District Attorney at New York
to institute proceedings for the recovery of the income supposed
to have been illegally withheld. By such a proceeding
they not only expected to subject Mr. Tilden to enormous expense
in reproducing records of his professional income
reaching back fifteen or twenty years, but to hold him up,
in the press, at least, until after the election or his retirement
from public life, as a defaulter to the government and
as a perjurer in his returns of his professional earnings.</p>

<p>This suit moved along very leisurely, but actively enough
to keep the subject and the victim of it before the public
during the election. Later on they realized that its partisan
uses not only had not been exhausted, but were more important
than ever to them; for the fraudulent means by
which Mr. Tilden had been deprived of the office to which
he was elected made him apparently the inevitable candidate
to succeed Mr. Hayes.</p>

<p>In due time the weakness of their machinations could no
longer be concealed, and in the winter of 1878 they were
obliged to confess that they never had any testimony on
which to go to trial in support of their caluminous allegations;
but to keep the charge alive in the servile prints of the
administration, they filed a "bill of discovery" to extort
from Tilden himself proof of their infamous charges. It
was in consequence of this aggravating persecution that Mr.
Tilden invited Mr. O'Conor to assist in his defence, which
led to the following correspondence.</p>

<p>The history of this vexatious and vicious prosecution will
be found in ample detail from its initiation, in 1876, to the
government's ignominious retreat, in 1882, in the <cite>Biography
of Tilden</cite>, p. 225.</p>

<h2>MEMORANDUM OF CASE FOR O'CONOR'S OPINION</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<i>March, 1879.</i>
</p>

<p>"A copy of the draft of the Bill of Discovery intended to
be filed in the United States Circuit Court is submitted. It
is for discovery merely, and is in aid of a common-law action
pending in the district court. The complaint in that action
is also submitted.</p>

<p>"Some of the questions on which Mr. O'Conor's opinion
is desired in the first instance are the following:</p>

<p>"First.&mdash;If to the Bill of Discovery a plea, or an answer
in the nature of a plea, should be made denying the right of
action of the United States in the suit in the district court,
and, consequently, its claim to a discovery on the ground that
the quasi judicial determination of the assessor as to the
amount of the tax, and the satisfaction of the judgment
rendered by him are conclusive against the United States,
and if the Circuit Court should overrule that point and grant
the discovery, would that decision of the Circuit Court be
a final judgment on which an appeal would lie to the Supreme
Court?</p>

<p>"Second.&mdash;Would that appeal probably be effectual to obtain
the rulings of the Supreme Court on the main question
of the controversy?</p>

<p>"First.&mdash;If to the Bill of Discovery a plea, or an answer
the defendant's income was in excess of the amount found
by the assessor to be his income, calls on the defendant to
state on oath every item of income during ten years, and
every item of deductions therefrom and many items of receipts
which are not income. There is no proposition between
the foundation and the superstructure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[585]</a></span></p>

<p>"What are the rules applicable to such a case?</p>

<p>"The interrogatories are not even limited to taxable income,
but would involve accretions of value which are not
taxable.</p>

<p>"Can the objection (<i>a</i>) that there is not any proper foundation
for any interrogations? (<i>b</i>) that an interrogatory is too
broad? (<i>c</i>) that an interrogatory relates to a matter in which
the plaintiff has no interest or concern, as, for instance, to a
subject not within the tax laws&mdash;can such objections be taken
by way of special plea if we prefer that mode?</p>

<p>"The opinion or advice on the first and second questions
is more emergent&mdash;the others can be dealt with later."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have your note requesting me to examine
some questions touching a bill of discovery. No papers accompanied
it except the original complaint and a copy of the
bill.</p>

<p>"This controversy has been some time in the courts. The
law case is at issue, and arguments and a judgment have been
had in it. The nature and merits of the law case should be
understood by any one who would venture to advise in the
equity case.</p>

<p>"It is true that I could investigate all this matter from
the beginning without aid from any one; but, considering
that you have had counsel in the law case, it seems to me that
a statement from them, with points referring to statutes and
authorities, might be put into my hands with advantage.
As this might facilitate my researches, it would expedite my
conclusion and you indicate a desire for speed.</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">To Charles O'Conor.</span>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The action of the United States in the
income tax case is a common-law action. The complaint
has been sent to you.</p>

<p>"The substance of the plea is that the defendant had been
assessed by the proper officers of the United States. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span>
tax and penalties fixed and the amount collected by the government.
A copy of the plea will be sent to you, but the
above is the substance of it.</p>

<p>"The question argued before Judge Blatchford in the
district court was on the point raised by the defendant that
the action of the government officers was quasi judicial, and
their determination conclusive and exclusive.</p>

<p>"The points of the defendant are sent herewith.</p>

<p>"In this state of things the District Attorney proposes
to file a bill of discovery to obtain the facts which shall establish
the right of action.</p>

<p>"It is understood that the District Attorney desires, if
possible, to have the judgment of the Supreme Court on the
main question. But that purpose may, perhaps, be regarded
as confidential.</p>

<p>"The advance sheets of the bill of discovery intended to
be filed, which had been informally furnished to one of the
defendant's counsel, have also been sent you.</p>

<p>"The first point upon which your opinion has been asked
is whether, in case we plead to the bill of discovery, that
the plaintiff is barred as to his right of action by the quasi
judicial determinations of the officers, and has no right to
discovery by reason of having no right of action, and that
plea is overruled by the Circuit Court, the decision will constitute
such a judgment as will be appealable to the Supreme
Court.</p>

<p>"There are other questions, but this is the most immediate.</p>

<p>"I write this note to give you information at once without
the delay incident to getting the counsel together to write
out a case for submission.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Judge</span>,&mdash;I thank you for your kind letter.</p>

<p>"The life I am leading with out-door exercise and physical
activity alternated with rest has left me little time for correspondence
after I get through with other calls upon my attention.
But I none the less appreciate intercourse with
such men as yourself. Nor do I forget that there are three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[587]</a></span>
generations since my ancestors were first allied to the great
founder of your family, amid the trying scenes which attended
our national independence, and the formation of a
genuine government of the people.</p>

<p>"You are quite right in the impression that I would not
think it fit for me to run for <i>Governor</i> at the coming election.
The reasons against it are conclusive.</p>

<p>"In the first place, I don't want to add to the burdens I
have had and now have connected with public affairs.</p>

<p>"In the second place, although I do not expect to be installed
in the Presidency to which I was elected, I deem it
due to the four and a quarter millions of voters who have
been defrauded of the fruits of their suffrages, that I should
not, during the term for which I was chosen, do anything
inconsistent with their moral right.</p>

<p>"In the third place, I should not like to be a convenience
to the dictation to the Democratic State convention that
they must surrender their choice if it be Governor Robinson,
whose administration has deserved so well of all good citizens.</p>

<p>"I have not time to dilate on these topics, but I do not
doubt that you and I will think the same things concerning
the Republic.</p>

you find time to write me, and I hope to have the pleasure
of seeing you personally.</p>

<p>"I concur with you in regarding the issue created by the
subversion of the election of 1876 as the most transcendent
in our history. The example of a reversal of the votes of the

successful and followed by prosperity to the wrong, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[588]</a></span>
be fatal to the system of elective government. <em>The hierarchy
of office-holders would maintain their possession indefinitely,

<h2>S. J. TILDEN&mdash;INTERVIEW WITH "SUN" REPORTER</h2>

"<i>Dec. 19, '79.</i>

<p>"A <cite>Sun</cite> reporter called on Mr. Tilden, showed him a copy
of the <cite>Sun</cite> of Sunday last containing an article copied from
the <cite>Star</cite>, and asked if it would be agreeable to him to say
whether there was any, and, if so, what foundation for the
statements there made about negotiations with him to obtain
the electoral vote of the State of South Carolina for $30,000.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tilden took the paper, ran his eyes over it, and
then said: 'I have no objection to answer your question if
my friends of the <cite>Sun</cite> think the publication worthy of such
notice.</p>

<p>"'I do not see, on looking this article over, any statement
concerning me personally which is not a mere fiction.</p>

<p>"'The substance of the story is that I was visited at my
house by a gentleman from South Carolina, who told me that
the vote of the State had been given to me, but that the Returning
Boards had determined to count it against me unless
they were paid $30,000; that after declining the proposition,
I recalled this agent by a letter addressed to him at his hotel;
that on the second interview I referred him to a gentleman
in this city; that that gentleman gave him a package containing
$30,000, which was sent to Charleston; that the letter
had scarcely left the wharf when the agent received another
letter from me requesting him to call at my house immediately;
that I then insisted upon the immediate return of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[589]</a></span>
package unopened, and that it be restored to the person from
whom it was received; that the agents remonstrated, saying:</p>

<p>"'"The corrupt men in Columbia and in the State generally
have not tried to count Hampton out. They know perfectly
well that both you and Hampton are elected and have
received a majority of the votes of the people, but they can
afford to count you out, but not to count Hampton out, because
he and his friends will not stand it."</p>

<p>"'That notwithstanding this remonstrance, I persisted in
requiring the package to be restored to the person who handed
it to the agent.'</p>

<p>"Mr. Tilden: 'Every one of these statements is totally
false; no one of the three pretended interviews ever happened.
I never sent either of the two letters attributed to
me; I never referred any agent bearing such a proposition to
Mr. Brown or to Mr. Anybody else. All the details concerning
the package of money being sent and recalled and my
conversations respecting it also are wholly destitute of truth.
They are simply a fabrication from beginning to end.'"</p>

also said, on my belief in Governor Seymour's sincerity, that

want to give you some news for your special information.</p>

<p>"I have a letter from a leading Democrat of Oneida
County who has peculiar facilities for getting at the 'true

the result will be uniformly that which was recently seen

No one will be authorized to say he will consent to

authentic will be got from him to show that he would not
accept a nomination.</p>

other way can that duty be so effectually performed as by
renominating and re-electing the old ticket. The masses are
emotional and sentimental rather than metaphysical. They
feel that the old coach stands ready to be hitched to, and
that, that done, a safe and prosperous journey is before them.</p>

<p>"If anything like a concerted appeal to the country had
been sustained by its leading Democratic press, the renomination
and reelection of the old ticket would have resulted
by an overwhelming vote. Nor is it too late now to amend
the omission, notwithstanding the supervening complication
of the late New York elections. Putting the latter upon a
salient issue of <em>principle</em> and <em>faith</em>: whether, indeed, the organization
and voice of the Democratic party in that State
shall prevail, or whether a predatory faction of bolters shall
be allowed to dominate both. Such an appeal ought and, I
think, would meet with an approving response from true and
tried Democrats.</p>

<p>"The bolters failing to retrace their steps, what else is left
but for a strong and emphatic demonstration to be made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[591]</a></span>
declaratory of the above issues. Pardon my boldness. I
deem it advisable, nay, necessary, for you to lead the way in
a speech or paper couched in such form and terms as you
may consider appropriate, and as will be effective to ring
throughout the land. A leader who is demonstrative will
always find followers.</p>

<h2>JOHN BIGELOW TO G. PITMAN SMITH</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">58 E. 34th St., New York</span>, <i>March 10, 1880</i>.</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Hon. G. Pitman Smith.</span>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Mr. Tilden has shown me your favor to him
of the 25th ult., and desires me to thank you for its friendly
counsel. In complying with his wishes, I will take the liberty
of adding a few words on my own account for which
I trust my cordial sympathy with the manifest objects of
your communication will be a sufficient apology.</p>

<p>"There is no one in this country, I suppose, who can suffer
more from a popular misunderstanding of his motives than
Mr. Tilden, but circumstances constrain him, no less now
than heretofore, to leave the vindication of his conduct as the
leader of his party in the last Presidential contest to its good
sense and its love of justice. There has been no time when
he could participate in any public discussion of the methods
finally adopted for counting the electoral vote, without appearing
to criticise the conduct of statesmen standing high
in the confidence of the Democratic party and whose patriotism
is above suspicion. That alone would be a sufficient reason
with him for maintaining silence, and for declining to
make of what might seem to some a personal grievance a
provocation of unprofitable party dissension.</p>

<p>"But in my judgment he had another and a better reason.
He knew that whenever, if ever, it should become
necessary for the people of the United States to pass judgment
upon his conduct during and subsequent to the canvass
of 1876 they could not fail to acquit him of any responsibility
for its final result.</p>

<p>"The logic of nations is far more rigorous than that of the
individuals composing it, and it would be doing the understanding
of the American people great injustice to suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[592]</a></span>
they cannot see that there was no time when Mr. Tilden
could have taken any step towards seizing the Presidency
with any color of right or with any prospect of success.
There were just two contingencies, and only two, in which
it would have been lawful and obligatory on Mr. Tilden to
take the oath as President of the United States.</p>

<p>"The first one would have been presented if Congress had
performed its constitutional duty: had counted the electoral
votes, and declared Mr. Tilden the chosen of the electoral
colleges. The duty of verifying the electoral votes is given
by the Constitution to the two Houses of Congress and to
them only; it has always been exercised by them at the choice
of every previous President from the foundation of the
government. It was known to all who came in contact with
Mr. Tilden&mdash;for he was unreserved in the expression of his
opinion upon that subject&mdash;that in his view this power and
duty of Congress was lodged nowhere else.</p>

<p>"The two Houses of Congress, however, did not see fit to
exercise that power nor to discharge that duty, and as a consequence
this contingency in which it would have been proper
for Mr. Tilden to take the official oath never presented itself.
Before the time fixed by law for counting the electoral
votes, Congress passed the electoral bill by which they practically
abdicated in favor of a tribunal unknown to and, in
my judgment, unknowable by the Constitution, and enacted
that the electoral commission should in the first instance
make the count, and that its count should stand unless overruled
by the concurrent action of the two Houses. This electoral
tribunal counted Mr. Tilden out, and counted in a man
who was not elected. Congress did not overrule their count,
in consequence of which the false count stood as law under
the act of Congress.</p>

<p>"The only other contingency in which it would have been
obligatory, or even lawful, for Mr. Tilden to have taken the
oath of office was in case of a failure in the choice of President
by the electoral colleges, the House of Representatives
had itself proceeded to make the election, voting by States
in the manner prescribed by the Constitution and pursued in
the election of John Q. Adams.</p>

<p>"This contingency, like the first, never presented itself,
and, both failing, any attempt on the part of Mr. Tilden to
seize the Presidency by violence would have been not statesmanship,
but simply brigandage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[593]</a></span></p>

<p>"Courage is too common a virtue among Americans for
any one to make a boast of it, and the lack of courage too
rare to explain the conduct of any body of representative
men. At the same time, there is no doubt that if there was
any place where a special display of heroism could have prevented
the defeat of the popular choice and installed the
elect of the people in the Presidential chair, that place was
the floor of Congress. I suppose I say nothing which any
Democratic member of that Congress will be disposed to dispute
when I state that it was the fear that the Senate would
lead a resistance to the rightful judgment of the House, and
that President Grant would sustain this revolutionary policy
with the army and navy, and with the militia of the great
States in which the Republicans had possession of the State
governments, that deterred the House of Representatives
from the assertion of its rights, and induced its vote for and
acquiescence in the electoral commission.</p>

<p>"But without speculating upon the causes or motives for
such vote and acquiescence the facts are beyond dispute.
The House of Representatives did not elect Mr. Tilden in
the manner prescribed by the Constitution or in any other.
On the other hand, it did concur with the Senate in anticipating
and preventing the contingency in which it might
have had to act, and in providing beforehand an expedient
which incapacitated it for supplying a failure of an election
by the colleges. It adopted the electoral law, and went
through all the forms of the electoral scheme. True, it
afterwards rebuked itself by passing a declaratory resolution
condemning the electoral commission, and asserting that Mr.
Tilden had been the choice of the people. But the Constitution
had not provided that a man should or could take office
as President on a declaratory resolution of the House of
Representatives. If that resolution could have had full effect
to abrogate the electoral law which the House had assisted
to enact, it would still have furnished Mr. Tilden with
no warrant of authority for taking the oath of office. Had
Mr. Tilden been declared President-elect by either of the
constitutional methods, no one who knows him can doubt that
he would have taken the oath and the office or sealed the
people's choice with his blood, as he was in duty bound to do.</p>

<p>"I do not weary you with the recapitulation of these facts,
because I suppose any of them new to you. On the contrary,
they are all now matters of history. It is because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[594]</a></span>
they are of public notoriety, and because they point so directly
to the one and inevitable conclusion that Mr. Tilden's
responsibility in the late canvass terminated at the ballot-box,
that I recall them here to justify in your eyes his silence
upon the subject referred to in your letter, and his perfect
faith in the good sense and justice of his countrymen.</p>

<p>"I need hardly say that in what I have here written in
explanation of Mr. Tilden's attitude before the country I
have written as his friend, not for him.</p>

which prompted your note of the 27th of January, and
it is not from any want of consideration for your suggestions
that I have not sooner acknowledged it. I thank you cordially

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Utica</span>, <i>April 6th, 1880</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Tilden</span>,&mdash;The Seymour movement is assuming
a shape which must draw from him, in a few days,
a more positive declination than he has yet made&mdash;unless he
is really looking for a nomination, and I am positive that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[595]</a></span>
he is not. I think he talks with me more, and more plainly,
than he does with anybody else. The misunderstanding of
his position (which perhaps you share) grows partly out of
the talk of his family and friends, and partly out of the impression
that he leaves on the minds of those with whom he
talks, that he is not particularly friendly to you. He is fully
and firmly resolved to go out of public life and remain out.
But he would like to take his contemporaries out with him.
That is all there is to his opposition. I have made a careful
study of this matter, and I am very confident that I am not
mistaken in my conclusions. A few days, however, will
show. Our district convention will probably adopt a resolution
urging Governor Seymour for President. A letter from
him, defining his position, will then be in order. The <cite>Observer</cite>
is floating in the local current, hopeful of directing it
when the time comes. Mr. Spriggs will probably go to the
State convention. He is with us, as you know. Mr. Grannis,
of the State committee, and Mr. Birt, of Bridgewater, are
talked of for the other two places. Of these three, Spriggs
will be the controlling spirit.</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Hon. S. J. Tilden, New York.</span>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have not the pleasure of knowing you personally.
I have never sought to make myself consequential in
your estimation, nor have I annoyed you with visits or
opinions. I am no politician, nor given to tricks nor to
pretentiousness. Without asking your pardon for doing so,
I take the responsibility of writing this letter.</p>

<p>"The crime in the Presidential count of 1877 was not
against you, nor was it against the Democratic party. It was
a crime against the American people and against popular
government. If the American people are worthy of popular
government they will visit their wrath upon the authors and
abettors of that crime. The most effective way to do so is
by your re-election. You have no right to deny them the
opportunity of doing so. You have no right to deny to the
Democratic party the privilege of presenting your name to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[596]</a></span>
the people, nor have you the right to relieve the party from
the shame of refusing to present your name to the people.</p>

<p>"For three years the Republicans have been laboring to
destroy your good name in order to avoid the issue the presentation
of your name will make. Certain Democrats
aided them in committing the great fraud, and they have been
aiding them to destroy you for the same reason. They say
they have succeeded. They seek to impress the public that
you are not available. I do not believe the American people
are idiots or knaves, nor are they ready to consummate their
own degradation at the bidding of this coalition of Republican
and Democratic politicians.</p>

<p>"I was a new man here in 1877 and was myself entrapped.
If I had known certain men then as I know them now, I am
almost vain enough to believe the electoral bill would not
disgrace our history. Be that as it may, I feel anxious to
atone for the wrong I helped to consummate by that bill.</p>

<p>"Some very recent events have added to my information,
and strengthened my convictions in regard to motives, persons,
and things potential in the wrongs of 1876-7.</p>

your favor only because I have spoken briefly.</p>

<h2>R. T. MERRICK TO TILDEN</h2>

<p>
"<i>Private and personal.</i></p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Washington City</span>, <i>June 11th, 1880</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Tilden</span>,&mdash;It may be desirable that you
should know something of what transpired at the Maryland
convention, in order to determine correctly the character and
sentiments of those by whom its proceedings were directed.</p>

<p>"Maryland is, as you are aware, the theatre for the operations
of a ring not unlike that which you hate in New York.</p>

<p>"This ring is under the control of Gorman, Colton, and
two or three others, with Governor Carroll as a subordinate
but confidential copartner.</p>

<p>"Carroll is violent in his hostility to you, and equally
violent and unreasoning in his devotion to Bayard.</p>

<p>"These gentlemen, though at one time committed to you,
came over to this city last winter and 'pledged' the State
to Bayard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[597]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bayard himself, I have occasion to know, designated
some of the delegates and advised the defeat of others. Five
days before the convention assembled he visited the residence
of Governor Carroll, where about a hundred and fifty men
of that particular Congressional district were invited to meet
him.</p>

<p>"Carroll resides in the same county in which I reside&mdash;viz.,
Howard.</p>

<p>"I was a candidate in that district for the position of delegate
against a ring ticket. I carried the district and secured,
of my friends in the convention and others not known
to me, but <em>instructed</em> to vote for me by the conventions that
appointed them, more than enough to elect me.</p>

<p>"But Carroll and his associates induced a sufficient number
of those who had been instructed openly to violate their
obligation of good faith and personal honor to defeat me.
I confidently believe that of the <em>people</em> of the district I had
two to one in my favor as against the <i>Bayard ring ticket</i>.</p>

<p>"Bayard and his friends seem to cherish a personal bitterness
to you and those interested in having justice done
to you, which is as blind as it is stupid.</p>

<p>"There are some few good men in the delegation, but it
is completely under Gorman's control, who will do everything
he can to secure Bayard's nomination, but directs his
efforts <em>principally</em> to <em>appear</em> on the successful side. I beg
leave to suggest that you intimate to such of your friends at
Cincinnati as may have your confidence, and be in possession
of your views and wishes, to be on their guard in any
consultation or interview they may have with this gentleman
or the members of this delegation.</p>

<p>"I presume Mr. Blair has written&mdash;he carried his county,
though not his district, and for reasons similar to those
indicated above is not a member of the delegation.</p>

<p>"With most profound respect,</p>

<p class="sig">
"Sincerely your friend,<br />
"<span class="smcap">R. T. Merrick</span>."
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As introductory to the following letter, I quote the following
from my diary under date of May 12, 1880:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mr. Tilden has finally determined, I believe, to be a
candidate for the Presidency before the Cincinnati convention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[598]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have no responsibility for advising him to expose himself
to such an ordeal in his present state of health, though
I rather congratulate myself that he has taken that responsibility
for himself. He has been so abominably calumniated
that nothing but a renomination and re-election can fully
vindicate him and his friends. Should the exposure cost him
his life, could it be spent in a better cause for him? As
long as he can make himself heard, he is capable of making
a better President than any man besides him that either
party is likely to nominate.</p>

<p>"While the Terre Haute and Alton suit was pending
against him, I think he was fully determined to withhold
his name from the convention. He complained to me, as we
were riding one day, of his want of the requisite strength to
prepare his defence, though sure of winning if the case were
promptly presented. He then added, 'If I have not strength
enough to prepare a case for trial I am not fit to be President.'
In saying this he turned to me as if it were in answer
or as a remonstrance against pressure to run. I said
to him: 'Governor, I am the last one to ask you or to urge
you to run. No one has a right to ask you to accept a burden
like that at the risk of your life, and there is no disguising
the fact that there is nothing from which you have so much
to apprehend as from excitement of any kind, and especially
of the kind and degree to which a canvass for the Presidency,
and the first six months' service in that position, would inevitably
expose you.' It was on that ground that I advised
him to settle the Terre Haute and Alton suit without reference
to the cost in money. It was fretting the life out of
him.</p>

<p>"Then just before the State convention for the election
of delegates to Cincinnati the income tax suit was noticed
for trial. This completely unsettled him for several weeks,
so completely that I was again confirmed in the conviction
that any increase, or even continuance, of excitement like
that under which he was laboring would soon destroy him."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Tilden's brother Henry took with him to Cincinnati
Mr. Tilden's letter to the Democratic national convention in
1880 declining a renomination to the Presidency, and this
letter pictures the confusion into which the convention was
thrown by it.</p>

<h2>SMITH M. WEED TO S. J. TILDEN</h2>

<p class="sig">"<span class="smcap">Friday</span>, <i>June 25, '80</i>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Governor</span>,&mdash;I have not had a moment's time
to write until now, and I have very little to write except what
you have already read in the papers.</p>

<p>"It was very apparent to any one that it was not possible
to have nominated you even if you would have taken it, as
I know you would not. The element that sold you out in
Washington in 1877, with those who were <em>honestly</em> fearful
you could not win, were enough to defeat you under any circumstances,
and yet the fear that we meant to try to do it
prevented our being able to.</p>

<p>"This feeling was kept alive by earnest but injudicious
friends of yours from New York and elsewhere, and this and
the action of our own delegation absolutely destroyed our
influence in the convention. The Brooklyn people did not
want you, and Jacobs, Pratt, and others told people they
would not go for you or be transferred by you. Had they
been absolutely with us, and had Manning spoken your
wishes, we could have nominated Mr. Payne. M. seemed
to fear the Brooklyn people, and I don't wonder, for I never
saw any set of men act so very ugly as they and the Fox-Shay
New York gang.</p>

<p>"Randall also acted bad, and talked bad, and yet, under
your advice, or what I took to be your advice, I acted with
the Brooklyn and Fox gang and named him as our second
choice. I did not like to do so, for I feared Hancock's nomination,
but did not fear it so early.</p>

<p>"Had your letter been there Saturday morning, and had
<em>we</em> all acted together&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, your friends&mdash;we could have
nominated Payne. I don't think we could have nominated
Randall.</p>

<p>"The South and Southwest and New Jersey were represented
by a bad lot, and the convention was nothing to compare
with the convention of 1876. So far as I was concerned,
I was good for nothing, for it took about all my time to keep
our delegation from kicking over the traces in some way.</p>

<p>"I cannot write in detail, but will talk it all over with
you if you want to know anything more of the disgusting
subject. I do not think it an easy victory for any one, and
am confident that the ticket is a fairer representation of <em>that</em>
convention <em>than you would have been</em>. The fact is that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[600]</a></span>
in the talk and action the old dictation of the South was
prevalent without the old intellect.</p>

<p>"I cannot express my contempt for New York's and
Brooklyn's acts.</p>

<p>"Barnum will tell you of the talks with Hancock people.
I hope he (H.) will make it apparent that he is to be your
friend, and if so that you will help him through. I am
about dead, as I have not slept over two hours a night since
I came.</p>

"<i>June 26, 1880.</i>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Though personally unknown to you, my
devotion to your interests, I think, warrants me in giving
you my sincere sympathy in your unjust defeat.</p>

<p>"I sent you, soon after your count out, the original resolutions
carried by me in county convention of Madison, which
was made the basis of the Louisville convention, and which
caused me to be made its president, without my solicitation,
being myself for a constitutional count without compromise.
I was a candidate for delegate for the State at large, and
was only beaten by your opponents and the Greenback element,
after I vindicated you in a speech which united all
the opposition against me. But as alternate of our mutual
friend, General William Preston, as directed by the convention,
I stood for you&mdash;till your letter of declension, which
left me free to defeat those who defeated you and me. The
position of Payne overshadowed by Thurman, with him,
Jewett, and Foster candidates, I foresaw that Payne could
not lead; and Randall had the opposition of all your opponents,
handicapped with the high tariff record, which is
more and more hateful to all Democrats. Under these circumstances,
I deemed Hancock the man of destiny. I
brought over seven of our delegation, and through my friend,
General W. C. C. Breckinridge, who was not a Hancock man,
pressed a vote on Wednesday, against all attempts of the
opponents of Hancock, and placed him in the lead, thus insuring
his selection on the second ballot Thursday, as we
anticipated. I had a great respect for Bayard, but told
General Wade Hampton and his other friends that his war
records and his action in the eight to seven commn. were
fatal objections; and now we have a man who is bound to win,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[601]</a></span>
as it seems to me, as you could have done but for your want
of health, as set forth in your letter. I spoke several times
in your behalf before our commn. at Lexington, and I honestly
believe you were the choice of seven-eighths of the people
of Kentucky. But the Congressmen defeated you&mdash;almost
all of whom were against you&mdash;first, because of your
Southern-claims letter, and that other principle of our weak
human nature, never to forgive those whom we have injured.</p>

<p>"General Preston grows old, has lost an eye, and is very
deaf: which sets him back in oratory&mdash;but he made with me
the only two speeches in your behalf in our Jefferson convention.
He was the first to leave Bayard for H&mdash;and is a true
gentleman and patriot. His speech in your behalf was very
able.</p>

<p>"I close by assuring you that your letter is one of the
ablest State papers of our annals; and brough[t] with all
intelligent and patriotic men conviction of your wrongs, your
ability, and your patriotism.</p>

<p>"Please accept assurances of my sincere respect.</p>

<h2>LETTER FROM H. A. TILDEN (NED) TO S. J. TILDEN</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Grand Hotel, Cincinnati, Monday, 9 o'c. A. M.</span>, <i>1880</i>.
</p>

<p>"I reached here at twelve; found Weed and Green at
station. Every one expected a letter, and a rush was made
to know all about it. I gave it to Mr. Manning as soon as
I could, and he read it over and had a copy&mdash;the original
he has and will keep&mdash;and deliver up to you on his return.
He wanted to do this. I yielded.</p>

<p>"On my way I had a room at one end of the car, and was
not disturbed, and saw no one till the last hour but Judge
Parkerson, and we only talked about last fall. He wanted
some explanation, which I gave, and relieved some wrong
impressions. I found that Tim Campbell admits that Robinson
was cheated out of over 20,000 votes. Pasters were
rubbed off, and the ballot counted for Cornell. The cheat is
estimated at enough to have elected Robinson. The delegation
had adjourned till Monday 10 <small>A.M.</small> I advised holding
the letter till then, and not make it public till read in convention.
This was intended, but the pressure was so great that
Weed, Manning, Barnum, and all hands wanted it as early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[602]</a></span>
as possible, that it would be of benefit on the Payne effort,
&amp;c., and they called a meeting of the delegation, read it, and
gave it to the press. I stayed up till three this morning to
see that the proof was all right. The sentiment it has
created is good, the antagonism all gone out, and regret takes
its place. Now they have no one to grumble about and fight.
There are three classes: those who are against us accept it
as final; the moderate men, who have doubted if we could
carry the State, want it reserved and not acted upon as final;
then there are our friends, who say it shall not be regarded,
and must come before the convention for final action.</p>

<p>"As the day wears on the sentiment in favor of the old
ticket will increase, and we cannot tell where it will end.
I don't believe any man can be picked up and get through
the convention. I think perhaps Whitney, Weed, and
Faulkner rushed Payne too sharp&mdash;did not do it in a suggestive
form&mdash;and they have got up a feeling with the Brooklyn
delegation. The Brooklyn people have started Pratt
lively, and, clashing with Payne men, got up considerable
feeling, and I hear Hughes has been deputed to charge you
with not having explained to him, as fully as you should,
the Payne relations. I have had no chance to talk with
Hughes, but shall quiet this sentiment. I can remove it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Monday</span>, <i>5.30 P.M.</i><br />
</p>

<p>"I have just left Manning. We construe your despatch
about P. to Randall as positive instructions to force a fight
on Payne, and M. is unwilling to modulate it, because he
greatly fears disaster.</p>

<p>"I have had a talk with Henderson and Babcock, and
they say the Standard Oil monopoly is so very unpopular
that they can't see their way clear to go P., and are anxious
to do all they can, and go with Manning, and fear the effect
in these elections. The Oil Company has ruined so many
men in this locality that it is impossible to get up a sentiment
for any one directly or indirectly in it; the same feeling
exists in Pittsburg, and those delegates will not go for Payne.
There is no Payne sentiment from any States but New York
and Ohio that I can hear of. I have sent you the enclosed
despatch, somewhat reduced, which Manning dictated.</p>

<p>"I send you a list of delegates as they stand at this hour.
The discussions are lively. Tilden men are cheered and have
all the sentiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[603]</a></span></p>

<p>"Faulkner is sour; thinks he is not fully consulted.
Manning is managing him best he can. There is little to
consult about. There is so much jealousy, and so many statesmen,
I am glad you are out. <em>Hewitt is in.</em> Green thinks
lightning may strike him. So we go. Have not heard from
Randall. Barnum was to see him, but has been so engaged
did not yet. One of the Illinois delegation says he cried
when he read the letter.</p>

<p>"The Pratt movement dates back a long way. Fowler
intent on securing delegates to represent certain interests,
and explains now how McL. declined to go as delegate at
large, and Jacobs came in and got from Manning a word
that any one satisfactory to McL. would be satisfactory, and
then put forward Pratt. Weed says that the Pratt movement
is made up of the mining speculating class, who have
made money, and brag they have more to put up for him than
Tilden would put in.</p>

<p>"Will close for mail. Will send full memorandum by
mail and telegraph important points.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Ned.</span>
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Strong objection to P., because of Oil Company in our
delegation; also because Brooklyn is aggressive for Pratt.
Thurman holds Ohio firmly; how long, uncertain. Steadman
has gone over to Jewett. Manning thinks it will never
do to push P. upon Ohio; she must act first. Several States
voluntarily agree to follow our lead.</p>

<p>"Shall we make fight now for anybody, or wait for developments?
Answer, yes or no."</p>

<p>General Winfield S. Hancock was nominated for the Presidency
by the Democratic convention at Cincinnati on the
23d day of June, 1880. A short time after, Mr. Tilden received
the following note from General Hancock at the hands
of General W. G. Mitchee, to which Mr. Tilden suggested the
addition which follows it.</p>

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I introduce my friend, General W. G.
Mitchee, who will hand you a copy of the lines of acceptance
which I have resolved to issue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[604]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will you have the kindness to read it and give me any
suggestions in regard to it which may occur to you? I intend
to issue the letter before the 1st of August.</p>

<p>"I also send for your perusal a copy of a letter which I
addressed to General Sherman under date of December 25th,
1876, which will no doubt be published a week or so after
my letter of acceptance.</p>

</p>

<p>"It is time we should enjoy the benefits of that reconciliation
and restoration of fraternal feelings which has cost so
much blood and treasure. As one people, having a common
interest, the welfare and prosperity of all would be advanced,
a generous rivalry would be stimulated for the growth of our
merchant marine which has been destroyed by the policy of
the party in power. The extension of our foreign and domestic
commerce with nations naturally tributary to us, and
the further development of our immense natural resources
would result. A wise and economical management of our
governmental expenditures should be maintained in order
that labor may be lightly burdened, and that every individual
may be protected in his natural right to the immediate fruits
of his own industry."</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <i>Sept. 17th, 1880</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Bryant</span>,&mdash;After I left the city two weeks
ago, thinking not so much where I would go as where I would
not remain, I found in my pocket a note which I supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[605]</a></span>
had been left to be sent to you. It was designed to aid an
article which has doubtless appeared in your household in
explaining its own advent&mdash;a friendly office, which, although
too long delayed, must still be fulfilled.</p>

<p>"I could not resist the impulse to supply what you had,
one day when I last had the pleasure of visiting you, casually
mentioned as your <em>only want</em>. It may never again happen
to me&mdash;if I lose that opportunity&mdash;to be able to fill the
measure of a housekeeper's contentment; and I am anxious,
if you will permit me, to procure for myself the gratification
of witnessing such a novelty, as well as the sense of having
contributed to produce it. Perhaps I ought to acknowledge
a still more selfish motive. If the example of so much
moderation shall have the influence to which it is entitled,
I shall, doubtless, at some period not yet distinctly foreseen,
share its benefits; and, notwithstanding all I can now do to
signalize my appreciation of it, be reminded that I am forever
your debtor. In the mean time, I remain, very truly,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Tilden</span>,&mdash;If I said, 'A bamboo settee is my
only want,' I had forgotten it long before your present arrived,
which certainly fills most commodiously a vacant space
in my hall or on my piazza, as the weather may be; and for
which I make you my very best acknowledgments. I do not
think I was a 'discontented housekeeper' before I had it,
but I admit I have much more reason to be contented now.</p>

<p>"I wish I could as easily send you in return the thing
you most want for your future household, or even tell you
where to obtain it. But permit me to say that I have observed
that people become more fastidious and less enterprising
the longer they postpone the acquisition of what, we
are told by high authorities, was the only thing wanted to
make the first man happy in paradise.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;I have received your invitation to be
present and address a meeting of the Young Men's Democratic
Club of the city of New York at Chickering Hall this
evening.</p>

<p>"My voice is not yet sufficiently restored to make it prudent
for me to address a large meeting. My cordial sympathy
with your efforts to elect General Hancock has already
been conspicuously expressed.</p>

<p>"As the canvass advances every day renders more manifest
the duty to promote that result incumbent upon all who believe
in the traditions of free, constitutional, representative
self-government as illustrated in the better days of the Republic.</p>

<p>"One Presidential election, as made by the people, has
been subverted by a false count of the votes cast by the Presidential
electors founded on a substitution of votes known to
be fraudulent or forged.</p>

<p>"If the next Presidential election should be controlled
by corrupt influence exercised by the government upon the
voters in particular States, opening a vista of third terms,
and an indefinite series of terms, and the undisputed mastery
of the office-holding class in the successive elections, our government
will be degenerated into a bad copy of the worst
governments of the worst ages."</p>


<h2>ALEXANDER T. McGILL TO TILDEN</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Theological Seminary</span>,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Princeton, N. J.</span>, <i>Nov. 27, '80</i>.</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Hon. Saml. J. Tilden.</span>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I cannot refrain from writing to you,
as I often desired to do in times past, to testify my respect
and admiration alike, when you were covered with merited
honors and persecuted with unmerited obloquy. I am an
old man, senior professor in this institution since the death
of Dr. Charles Hodge. Mr. J. F. D. Lanier first made me
acquainted with your character, and my wife met you once
at his residence near Lenox, where she was on a visit to her
particular friend, Mrs. Lanier. I am a native of western
Pennsylvania, and was professor in the Theological Seminary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[607]</a></span>
of Allegheny until 1854, when the Presbyterian General
Assembly transferred me to this seminary as successor to
Dr. Archibald Alexander.</p>

<p>"I am indebted to you for the surpassing ability and
probity with which, in connection with Lanier, you saved my
savings, which I had invested in the Pennsylvania and Ohio,
now 'The Wayne' Railroad. It was therefore my duty,
when you were abused by various lying papers on every occasion,
to tell my own personal knowledge of the rare integrity
with which you secured to a multitude of poor men
what we thought was lost in the bankruptcy of that great
road. My son, a lawyer in Jersey City, 'Prosecutor of the
Pleas' for Hudson County, was vastly more efficient, of
course, in using the information I gave him. I have now
three sons in Jersey City, professional men, who would rejoice
exceedingly to have the opportunity of yet voting for
you if you ever consent again to a nomination for the Presidency.</p>

<p>"We all rejoice in the downfall of that wicked and
treacherous conspirator, John Kelly. His vindicative antipathy
to you now meets a recompense in the just indignation
of Providence. It is the signal overthrow of this bad
man which prompts me to write these lines at this time, to
congratulate you that your faithful and distinguished life
is illustrated by that detestable enemy in the foil of his
nature coming to the notice of all men sooner than we expected.</p>

<p>"Pardon me for tasking you to read so long a letter. I
think it is due to you from me to inform you a little more
how deeply you are esteemed and loved for your integrity,
pureness, patriotism, and moral courage. Not one in a thousand
of our best public men would have relinquished the
Presidency when it was fairly in his grasp, and that, too,
for the sake of peace. History will do you justice. A
memorial unique and grand, better far than the actual Presidency,
showing to all generations the moral sublimity of an
American citizen, will be yours. May your precious life and
health be long preserved.</p>

<p>"With great respect and true friendship,</p>

<h2>TILDEN TO MONTGOMERY BLAIR</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Greystone</span>, <i>Nov. 29, 1880</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Blair</span>,&mdash;If I seem slow in replying to your
letter of the 10th inst., you must ascribe it to the difficulties
presented by its chirography which have not been surmounted
until this morning. As your productions always repay a
real perusal, a third and successful attempt to read that letter
was persisted in.</p>

<p>"In this connection I must tell you a story. Mr. Cambreling
wrote Mr. Van Buren a long and argumentative letter
in favor of the annexation of Texas while the latter was
preparing his letter upon that subject. It was written in an
ink which stuck the pages together, and Van Buren was
foiled or gave up in the attempt to decipher it. I have a
vague impression that he afterwards thought that letter might
have modified his own view. Possibly it might have changed
the course of events.</p>

<p>"Mr. Smith has brought up some photographs of three
sorts. I send herewith three of each kind.</p>

<p>"If a man can afford the slightest pleasure to friends
who have been so partial, so kind, and so faithful by a photograph,
it is a real delight to comply with their wishes.</p>

<p>"I have not yet gone down to the city for the winter, and
probably shall not until next week.</p>

<p>"My health is gradually improving, and I intend to persevere
in living a purely physical life, alternating between
out-of-door exercise and rest until the experiment shall have
been fairly and fully tried.</p>

<p>"With best regards to Mrs. Blair, and to the other members
of your family,</p>

</table></div>

<p>"These eight counties, having a population of about
350,000 and nearly 100,000 voters, gave to the Kelly bolt
in 1879 only 410 votes, and in 1880, as compared with 1876,
they lost only 684. If only this ratio of loss had obtained
throughout the State, our candidates would have succeeded
by more than 25,000 majority.</p>

<p>"But political cowards lacked the courage so to bear themselves
as to command success. At the behest of the malcontents,
who only one year before had fatally conspired
against the Democratic party and its principles, they committed
the cowardly act of calling the Saratoga convention
for the avowed purpose of reinstating the traitors of 1879,
and restoring them to influence and power. Being thus restored
to position and power, the figures above presented are
useful as tending to show how that power was used.</p>

<p>"This, however, is by no means the only act of political
cowardice connected with the late canvass. In 1876 the people
elected Mr. Tilden to the Presidency. There is not at
this day an intelligent, fair-minded man in America who
doubts it. He was cheated of his rights, and the people
were defrauded of their choice of President by the most
atrocious crimes known to civilization. The time arrived
to select a candidate for 1880. Mr. Tilden still lived, and,
though his physical powers were somewhat impaired, he was
conceded to be one of the ablest statesmen living. He was
reluctant to enter upon the canvass, and asked the people to
relieve [him] of so great a burden. Those by whom the
crimes referred to were committed, impelled by the desire
for self-protection, had devoted themselves for years to unprecedented
efforts to destroy him. The logic of the situation,
and the exercise of a manly courage, pointed to one single
line of duty. That duty was to refuse to accede to Mr.
Tilden's request, and to move forward with united voice and
action to right the great wrong that had been done by placing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[611]</a></span>
him in nomination and electing him to the office from
which he had been excluded only by the high crimes of his
adversaries. Instead of doing this, men forgot their courage,
and took counsel only of their fears. They listened to the
clamor of the criminals by whom this great man was maligned,
and allowed themselves to be intimidated even by the
malcontents who defeated the party only one year before.
Mr. Tilden was abandoned, and another candidate was selected.
That abandonment was a most conspicuous act of
cowardice! And who shall say it has not borne just such
fruit as might have been expected?</p>

<p>"The selection made was undoubtedly an excellent one.
General Hancock is a true, pure, and able man, and eminently
worthy of the high place for which he was named. His
nomination was, however, the outcome of a great act of
cowardice, and there is not a State in the Union in which
multitudes of men did not experience a feeling of disgust
at the manifest lack of courage to stand manfully and do
what clearly ought to have been done.</p>

and the civil struggles out of which our system of government
emerged, and the controversies through which was

centralize the action and influence of official authorities&mdash;to

as a corrupt balance of power in the elections, and then
shaping legislation and administration in the interests of
the few against the many&mdash;the precepts and example of such
a man as Mr. Jefferson cannot be too often invoked.</p>

<h2>TILDEN TO BIGELOW</h2>

<h3>(HIS HEALTH FIVE YEARS BEFORE HIS DEATH)</h3>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">15 Gramercy Park, New York</span>,<br />
"<i>Monday evening, January 31, 1881</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Bigelow</span>,&mdash;I have just received and read
your letter of the 18th, and resolve to answer it on the
spot. I seem to be free from all engagements and obstructions,
and am desirous to atone as far as possible for delinquencies
in respect to your two former letters. At the
end of two lines, however, I was compelled to refuse to admit
a caller. With John's help, to whom I am dictating, both of
us sitting before the wood-fire in the dining-room, I will
ramble through a few of the many things I would like to
say.</p>

<p>"I was not without hope that you had heard of me through
Poultney. Mrs. Bigelow gave me a charge to take some care
of the desolate members of the family remaining in America,
and I have been doing a little to entertain Poultney.</p>

<p>"In respect to my personal health, I cannot make a very
decided report, although, on the whole, I think I am improving.
I am taking no tea and rarely any coffee. I substantially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[613]</a></span>
take no medicine internally. For a month past
I have been trying electricity&mdash;the continuous current from
a galvanic battery&mdash;with some apparent advantage. When
you consider that the latter period of my work was passed
under the aid of the borrowing power of the will, and with
some help from medicine to hold my own&mdash;when these are
withdrawn, is in itself a gain. The later impression is that
I have taken rather too much exercise; that the malady is
an exhaustion of the central nervous force by overwork and
overwear, and that rest rather than physical activity is indicated.
It is a problem to avoid fatigue, and yet take exercise
enough to keep in order the general functions and
particularly the digestion. You will see the situation does
not favor very active travel or overmuch sight-seeing or
sociable festivities&mdash;but I am going too much into detail and
yet imperfectly. It is better to reserve opinions for a month
or two longer.</p>

<p>"Whether I can go over early enough to do much in Italy
is not easy now to say. My disposition is to cross the ocean
at some time in the spring. I am snugging up my affairs,
and getting out of the way all business matters. Indeed, that
is substantially done.</p>

<p>"I should like to know what your own plans are for the
spring and summer, or, if they have not taken definite shape,
what your contemplations are.</p>

<p>"I am not troubling myself much about business, but
perceive a tendency in little things of my own and everybody
else to come in and occupy the vacancy. I do not propose to

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Mr. Tilden requests me to acknowledge
the receipt of your two notes, and to say that he gives them
the earliest attention in his power.</p>

<p>"It is a settled policy of Mr. Tilden to abstain from all
transactions which may impose upon him any future care.
What he can afford to do he gives outright. In addition to
claims upon him from kinship or other special relations,
every day brings to him more applications by letter and by
personal appeal than is possible for him to grant.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tilden has every disposition to be kind to you, and,
as a token of his good-will, sends his check for two hundred

which he hopes will be more serviceable to you than the
loan suggested.</p>

<h2>FROM THE NEW YORK "HERALD," MARCH 5, 1881</h2>

<h3>(MR. HAYES GOES OUT)</h3>

<p>"A rough Republican wit remarked, the other day, that
'Mr. Hayes came in by a majority of one and goes out by
unanimous consent.'</p>

<p>"We are not certain that this is quite accurate. A good
many people will remember that Mr. Hayes gave the country
peace and rest for four years, and that, while he did not
make the unimpeachably 'clean' administration of which
some of his favorites boast, and did continually, and as may
be justly said, brazenly violate his repeated pledges for civil
service reform, he managed to avoid great scandals. Most
of his Southern appointments were disgraceful; they were
worse even, for they did great harm, and there is no denying
the truth of the accusation that he put, or kept, corrupt and
base men in office&mdash;not a few, but dozens upon dozens&mdash;to
reward them for political and personal services of a kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[615]</a></span>
which no decent public man would recognize. But he passed
two or three years in the White House in constant terror of
threatened disclosures which would compel him to leave the
Presidency a disgraced man, and he probably regarded the
improper appointments he made as necessary in self-defence.</p>

<p>"The very general contempt and dislike of Mr. Hayes,
felt and openly expressed by public men of both parties, rests,
we believe, on a sound basis. That he took the Presidency,
knowing he was not elected to it, forms but the smaller part
of the ground for this feeling; for, after all, he took it on
the decision of a high court of arbitration which was final.
His real offence is that he took office at the hands of his
party, having carefully deceived it up to the last moment
as to his purposes when he got what they only could give him.
That great and, in a free government, criminal act of deceit
has rightly called down on him the lasting dislike and contempt
of his party's leaders and of honest men in both
parties."</p>

feel with greater force the duty you owe to yourself, and
to all, to gather your materials to fix your place in the history
of the country. I once spoke to you of this, and you said
you would recur to it.</p>

<p>"If you had filled an administration, the records of it
would have marked your influence on the progress of the
country, but you did not.</p>

<p>"You must gather them, under your own supervision,
collect, select, and arrange them, and give the general outline
of your positions and purposes yourself.</p>

<p>"It is what the French call, '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Memoirs pour Servir</i>.'
There are many passages where autobiographical sketches
will be very valuable.</p>

<p>"You run this great risk of the future: that, while in one
light your action after the election may be regarded as in the
highest sense patriotic, in the other it may be said that your
failure to be President was because of something you lacked.</p>

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;At Washington last week I took a tentative
look at the business you wot of. The Attorney-General
was made to understand the whole affair. He is anxious
to be amiable, and, I think, would stop this dirty persecution
at once but for Blatchford's decision, which I cannot
help but admit is an embarrassing fact, though seen to be
perfectly lawless. He proposes that a memorial or formal
application be made which he will refer to the local authorities
for their report, and he promises to do whatever he can
to accomplish the object. He is, of course, not fool enough
to believe that the proceeding against you is justified by law.
He thinks you had better give a final judgment for any
amount that the District Attorney wants, coupled with a protest,
and trust to a writ of error.</p>

<p>"The thing looks badly. An appeal to the magnanimity
of these people will be so humiliating that I don't see how
you can go through it. It will have to be discussed officially
and unofficially by the inside and the outside of the administration&mdash;in
public and in private, and I do not know when
it will be ended. Speeding to-day, it may be put back to-morrow,
and be lost at last. On the other hand, if you give
a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro forma</i> judgment, your chances of reversal will be in
inverse proportion to the amount of it for certain reasons
which I need not now give.</p>

<p>"I think Blaine would have manhood enough to do right,
disregarding all other considerations, and sense enough to
see that he would make more politically than he would lose,
if the responsibility rested entirely upon him, but he is not
in a situation to force his advice upon the others.</p>

<p>"The President is not at all equal to such an occasion.
He will probably think it a kind of duty to repeat wrongs
upon a man whom he has already injured.</p>

<p>"Please to think over all this at your leisure, and decide
whether it is not best to defy these devils to their worst.</p>

<p>"It seems to me appropriate to the cordial friendship existing

respect to that investment has changed. I desired before I
should go into the country, and especially if I should decide
to go abroad, to revise my knowledge in respect to that investment;
and before I had completed my investigation it seemed
prudent to reduce my interest or dispose of it altogether. I
have substantially done the latter.</p>

"<i>September, 1881.</i>
</p>

<p>"The citizens of Yonkers, convened in public meeting, on
the invitation of the Mayor and Aldermen of the city, and
presided over by the civic authorities, resolve:</p>

<p>"<i>First</i>&mdash;That the death of the President of the United
States by the individual crime of a private assassin is a deplorable
event in our national history; that the evil example
is intensified by the occurrence of such an event a second
time within about sixteen years; that such treason against
the elective sovereignty of the people tends to encourage
future attempts to subvert the Chief Magistracy of the Republic
by criminal violence, under the influence of progressively
increasing temptations to personal resentments and
private malignity, which are incident to the ever-growing
power and patronage of the executive office; and that all
good citizens ought to join in every wise measure for limiting
these temptations, and for restoring and strengthening
every moral security which heretofore surrounded the First
Citizen of the Republic as he moved without guards among
the people.</p>

<p>"<i>Secondly</i>&mdash;That to Mrs. Garfield and the other members
of the bereaved family of the heroic sufferer and illustrious
victim is given our heart-felt sympathy and condolence."</p>

<p class="sig">"<span class="smcap">Greystone</span>, <i>October 3, 1881</i>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have received your letter stating you
intended to call on me and your inability to do so.</p>

<p>"I should have written to you earlier except for an illness,
and the pressure of claims upon my attention during
my convalescence.</p>

<p>"It would have been agreeable to me to have seen you,
and to have treated you with that frankness and courtesy
you have always experienced from me.</p>

<p>"In respect to your assurance that you would not be a
candidate for nomination, if your nomination 'would be
disagreeable to me and be discountenanced by me,' I have to
say that I cannot assume any such position. I have neither
the right nor the wish to exclude you from a legitimate and
honorable competition for any public trust. My practice,
when I was at the head of the party organization, was not
to become a partisan of any particular candidate, but to confine
myself to such advisory suggestions as might seem fit
and useful during the deliberations of the convention; to
defer largely to the judgment of the best men of the counties,
formed at the convention, in view of immediate action on the
complex considerations which enter into the formation of a
collective ticket. I need not say that I have not undertaken
any such function on the present occasion, and have not
possessed myself of the information to make me competent
to such a work. I assume that you have not given credit
to the idle fictions of Republican and other newspapers
which ascribe to me a desire to control the nominations and
canvass for the present year with a view to becoming a
candidate for Governor next year. The truth is, I ran
for Governor in 1874 simply for the purpose of sustaining
the reform movement to which I had given the three preceding
years, and I should not have continued in the office
for a second term in any possible event; nor would I
now entertain the idea of returning to it, even if I flattered
myself that I would receive a unanimous vote of the
people.</p>

<p>"All I desire for the Democratic party in the coming canvass
is, that it shall make the best possible choice of candidates,
and do everything to advance the principles of administration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[621]</a></span>

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Smith</span>,&mdash;Will you see Mr. Cooper and communicate
to him the following:</p>

<p>"The view which I took of the matter talked about between
Mr. Cooper and myself yesterday is unchanged. If
nothing can be raised in New York for the State committee,
the best way is frankly to communicate the fact. It could
scarcely be expected to foray on one man for the whole supplies
desired. I am subject to a continual running fire of
contributions. To deal with them, and with the applications
now before me, or sure to come, will be as much as ought to
be expected from me.</p>

<p>"When I was at the head of the committee I stopped
the practice of distributing funds from the State committee
to the localities; and nothing of the kind was done in any
campaign which I directed, or in which I was a candidate.
I doubted the system, and can scarcely be expected to renew
it single-handed on my individual account.</p>

<p>"Of course, nobody will give or take any trouble to
collect money, if all that is necessary is to ask one man for it.</p>

<p>"I do not just now feel very affluent. I have given
away so much this year, and have been led into such large
expenses that I am trenching upon my capital, and do not
feel as indifferent to unnecessary extravagance as I might
under other circumstances.</p>

<h2>HARRIET F. TYLDEN TO TILDEN</h2>

<p class="sig">

"<i>3d Decr. 1881</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Governor</span>,&mdash;In looking through the books in
the library at Chilham Castle yesterday I came across four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[622]</a></span>
ponderous volumes of Halsted's <cite>History of Kent</cite>, published
about one hundred years ago. In referring to the index of
the second and third volumes, I found several entries of the
name of <i>Tilden</i> as holding possession of manors in the reign
of King Henry the Second. There was a parish called
Tilden also, but, in the reign of Charles the First, the names
of Tilden and Tylden seem to be used indiscriminately to
designate the same individual. This carries out my husband's
often-disputed assertion that there were family records
in existence when he was a child proving that Tilden was
the original name; but that, in the reign of Charles the First,
the family divided into two branches, one following the
fortunes of King Charles, calling themselves Tylden, and
the other who sided with Cromwell, keeping to the old spelling,
<i>Tilden</i>. And it seems to me that the Puritan names in
your family, 'Samuel,' 'Solomon,' goes far towards proving
the truth of the statement. We, while adopting the 'Y'
in the surname, have kept fast to the Christian names of
Richard and of John, but especially Richard. Nearly every
Tilden in Halsted's History for centuries past has borne
this Christian name. I think it likely you may have seen
the book or have had extracts from it made for you. Should
such <em>not</em> to be the case, I shall be <em>only too pleased</em> to copy
out everything relating to your ancestors from the history
at Chilham Castle. A lady in Kent is busy on a genealogy
of the Tyldens, but as yet I have not seen it, and no doubt
she differs from my husband in thinking the Tildens dropped
the 'y' and inserted an 'i' in the time of Cromwell when
they are supposed to have emigrated to America.</p>

<p>"I hope you continue in good health. We have seen your
name prominently brought forward during the elections. The
weather was dreadfully rough here after your nieces sailed.
I hope they got safely back.</p>

<p>"I expect Dick to spend his Christmas with me. Katie
is staying with a friend, but I expect her home next week.
Mr. Parnell has done great harm in Ireland: six hundred
ladies are in the Unions (parish work-houses), owing to non-payment
of rent.</p>

<p>"In respect to your starting a newspaper and keeping his
name 'at the masthead as the Democratic nominee for President
in 1884,' I would say that Mr. Tilden started in life
and passed almost through the allotted time of human existence,
on the theory of performing all the duties which
a citizen of the Republic owes to the State without ever
entering upon an official career. His entrance into public
life was a deviation from his plan, made for a temporary
period and for a special purpose. He has no desire, I think,
to again quit his home, his books, and his private pursuits.</p>

<h2>GEORGE CARY EGGLESTON TO TILDEN</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">797 Greene Avenue, Brooklyn</span>, <i>2 Aug. 1882</i>.

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;May I trespass upon your attention,
briefly, in behalf of a literary undertaking in which I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[624]</a></span>
you will feel an interest? The facts are these: Mrs. Charlotte
M. Clarke, who has won a very decided success as a
novelist while writing under a pseudonym, has now in press
a novel of a good deal more than ordinary breadth and power,
in which she treats the social and political history of this
country during the period immediately preceding the late
war and later. It is now her purpose to carry the review
forward in another novel to be entitled <cite>The Theft of an
Empire</cite>, and to concern itself with the events of 1876.</p>

<p>"From the character of the work now in press, which I
have had occasion to read in proof, I am satisfied that in the
hands of this writer the story of the election frauds of 1876
will have such a dramatic setting forth as will command
respect and attention in quarters where the facts are now misconstrued.
I need not suggest to you the potency of fiction
to impress truths of this nature upon minds which receive
such truths in no other way, but I may assure you that I
know of no author likely to make so effective use of this
material as Mrs. Clarke.</p>

<p>"The lady already has possession of very valuable materials,
and in making further collections she will have the
active assistance of some of the most prominent editors and
public men of the country, who are her friends; but she is
especially anxious to get possession of certain facts which you
can doubtless furnish at once, but which it would be difficult
to get elsewhere. In her eagerness to get full and accurate
information for this purpose, she asks the privilege of an
interview with you at your own convenience, and my own
interest in the due performance of this necessary work induces
me to make this request for her. With respect to myself,
and the sincerity of my interest in the establishment
of historic truth in this connection, I beg to refer you to
my friend Mr. Parke Godwin, under whom I served upon the
editorial staff of the <cite>Evening Post</cite>.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Clarke is staying for a few days at the Hotel Branting,
Madison Avenue and Fifty-eighth Street, and, if you are
willing to grant her request for a brief interview, she will
call upon you at any time you may name, and will trespass
as little as may be upon your time.</p>

<h2>MARY TILDEN TO S. J. TILDEN</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">St. Olave's, Trinity Crescent, Folkestone</span>, <i>Oct. 12, 1882</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Some few years back I heard that you came
to England to look up some of your relations. I so much
regret that I did not have the pleasure of making your acquaintance,
as we are the old family of Tildens of Ifield
Court in the parish of Northfleet.</p>

<p>"I have always heard my husband say that there were
three branches of the Tilden family: one lived at Milsted
(Sir John Tylden), they altered the spelling of the name;
one branch went to America, and the other to Ifield Court.
My husband was the fourth John Tilden who had lived at
the old place; we were married in 1838, and I lived there
with him thirty-four years, as he died in 1872 at the age of
seventy-six. He was twenty years older than me; we have
three children&mdash;my eldest son John still has Ifield Court.
My daughter Lucy married, in 1868, Captain Miller, of the
Royal Engineers; he died of typhoid fever at Gibraltar in
1876, leaving his wife and four children&mdash;three girls and
one boy; they are now living with me. William, my youngest
son, is a major in the Sixtieth Rifles; he has just engaged
himself to be married to a Miss Bell, a lady of good family
and connections.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[627]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you should visit England again, I hope I may have
the opportunity of meeting you. I have long wished to write
to you, but did not know where to address you. This summer
I was spending a few weeks at Thonne in Switzerland,
and an American gentleman and his wife were staying at
the hotel. They were struck with my name and asked if we
were related to you. I asked if he would give me your
address, which he did, and I made up my mind to write to
you as soon as I returned home.</p>

<p>"There is a church not far from here called Lynne, where
Canon Jenkins took me to see where some of our ancestors
were buried, spelling their names as we do, <i>Tilden</i>. My
dear husband was very proud of his family; his brothers are
all dead; he has only three sisters living; there <em>were</em> twelve
in the family. I hope you will pardon my writing to you,
but I feel you would like to know something of the Ifield
Court, Tildens.</p>

<p>"My daughter unites with me in kind regards to her kinsman,
and believe me,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Lowell</span>,&mdash;I received, on Saturday evening,
your letter dated November 3d, and take the first time at
my command to answer it.</p>

<p>"You do not overestimate the influx of communications
which you are pleased to term 'begging letters.' They count
by thousands. It is only in rare and exceptional cases that
they can be answered. To comply with their requests would
overmatch the journalistic exaggerations of the income and
fortune which, in the mind of each applicant, is compared
with a single want, presented as most meritorious, and as
very inconsiderable in amount.</p>

<p>"I had occasion to tell the principal of a college, who tried
to tempt my vanity with the offer to call an edifice by my
name, that I should regard it as a calamity to be published
as a philanthropist&mdash;having discovered that a dim suspicion
of that character is scarcely consistent with the repose of a
retired life.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I am open to consider the case to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[628]</a></span>
you call my attention. Would it be convenient to you, some
day when I am in New York, to call upon me, or to send

it needs and what your plans are? If so, I will make
an appointment not earlier than next week.</p>

<p>"It is sad to think of Louis Blanc and Gambetta, who
have just passed away. In September and October, 1877,
when Mr. Bigelow and I were in Paris, we saw something of
them. Louis Blanc was an intelligent, mild man of gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[629]</a></span>
manners, and with the air of a scholar or professor. Gambetta
seemed to be an impersonation of great forces. I

enough of American politics to sympathize with the view
you take of the electoral transaction of 1876-7.</p>

<h2>HENRY ADAMS TO TILDEN</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">1607 H Street, Washington</span>, <i>24 Jan., 1883</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your kind letter of the 12th, acknowledging
the receipt at some past time of a copy of <cite>New England
Federalism</cite>, reached me yesterday. I am forced to confess
that I have equally forgotten sending you the book, and can
recall nothing except the fact that I sent you my <cite>Life of
Gallatin</cite> in consequence of assistance which you rendered me
in regard to it. Probably the other book was sent in the same
connection. I am quite sure that while in Europe, where I
went for papers after the <cite>Gallatin</cite> appeared, I received a
letter of acknowledgment from you for the volume.</p>

<p>"To do justice to Gallatin was a labor of love. After
long study of the prominent figures in our history, I am more
than ever convinced that for combination of ability, integrity,
knowledge, unselfishness, and social fitness Mr. Gallatin
has no equal. He was the most fully and perfectly
equipped statesman we can show. Other men, as I take hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[630]</a></span>
of them, are soft in some spots and rough in others. Gallatin
never gave way in my hand or seemed unfinished. That
he made mistakes I can see, but even in his blunders he
was respectable.</p>

<p>"I cannot say as much for his friends Jefferson, Madison,
and Monroe, about whom I have been for years hard at work.
In regard to them I am incessantly forced to devise excuses
and apologies or to admit that no excuse will avail. I am
at times almost sorry that I ever undertook to write their
history, for they appear like mere grasshoppers kicking and
gesticulating on the middle of the Mississippi River. There
is no possibility of reconciling their theories with their acts,
or their extraordinary foreign policy with dignity. They
were carried along on a stream which floated them, after a
fashion, without much regard to themselves.</p>

<p>"This I take to be the result that students of history
generally reach in regard to modern times. The element of
individuality is the free-will dogma of the science, if it is
a science. My own conclusion is that history is simply social
development along the lines of weakest resistance, and
that in most cases the line of weakest resistance is found as
unconsciously by society as by water.</p>

residence at New Haven, I find myself only partially prepared

other matters, I left without bethinking me of that duty.</p>

<p>"Your correspondence shows that you entered Yale College

the close of that term never to return, for in December you
were settled in New York. I find no evidence of your having
returned to college in the fall.</p>

While the early plans of my father and his associates,
Judge Kent and Mr. David Graham, Jr., were not
carried out according to their full intention in its foundation,
the later years of the school have been full of encouragement,
and it is now prospering under good management. The

drawn from those students who must make their way in the

<h2>W. P. SCOTT TO TILDEN</h2>

<p>
"<i>Personal.</i></p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">New Orleans</span>, <i>Sept. 16th, 1883</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;There come times in men's lives when, it
matters not how carefully they have builded, how deep the
structure strikes its foundations, or how critically material
shall have been selected, all fail if the keystone be not placed
skilfully, in season, and well.</p>

<p>"In these States, your sagacity, ability, firmness, and
all that pertains to stamp the man as leader, is recognized to
such an extent that it renders success impossible to any but
yourself. The scheme of politicians may succeed in party
conventions, but when candidates nominated by the party
appear 'in the fierce light that beats around the throne,' the
Democracy will soon find that the voters have discovered that
a stronger element has been discarded than won, if you be
not nominated.</p>

<p>"In 1880 success was impossible without your name for
President, and the case applies with equal vigor at this moment.
Since your resignation of its command, drift has been
its policy, blunder its action.</p>

<p>"In '74, when nominated for Governor of your State, a
Republican majority of 50,000 stared you in the face; your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[634]</a></span>
former efforts in the interests of reform nominated you; you
had builded well.</p>

<p>"The 14th of September, '74, in this city, drew aside the
full curtain and allowed the American people to view the
workings of Republican reconstruction in the South; showed
how hollow the Republican State government was, and committed
the general government to the 'bayonet policy' more
absolutely than ever. The people of Louisiana appealed to
the nation, through the mouths of cannon, to free her of her
oppressors, who were at the moment attempting to deny the
right of citizens to keep and bear arms. The leader of that
movement was Fred N. Ogden whom C. A. Burke is now
vigorously opposing for the Governorship of this State, which
nomination takes place in a few months and the election in
April, '84. When the convention meets it will in all probability
elect delegates to the national convention.</p>

<p>"Two years before your nomination the Democratic party
was not able to place a candidate in the field for President,
and in '76 elected a President. Louisiana contributed her
eight votes to yourself, and maintained, through Fred N.
Ogden, on the 9th of January, '77, the genuineness of her
vote by destroying every opposition to the Nicholls government,
and compelling Hayes to stamp his election as fraudulent
without recourse.</p>

<p>"When your election for Governor took place the people
were not disappointed, and your reforms heightened the enthusiasm
engendered by the campaign of '74, and made your
nomination certain for the highest office in the gift of the
people. You know much better than myself the causes of its
end, and suffice to say that, in my opinion, your patriotism
came to me in a stronger and purer light than ever before
by your action in not precipitating a civil war of unknown
consequences.</p>

<p>"At this moment the situation of the Democratic party is
this, in my opinion:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="democratic situation">
<tr><td align="left">Electoral votes South</td><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="right">153</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[635]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are the only man who can carry New York and fill
the void that her loss would incur.</p>

<p>"Now, I ask you, Mr. Tilden, to ponder well the refusal
of yourself through friends for the candidacy of President.</p>

<p>"Have you not placed yourself so high that you cannot
refuse; cannot even afford to deny the right of your friends
to run you for your just vindication?</p>

<p>"Let your friends announce that you will accept the responsibility
if nominated, however great the sacrifice, and
your nomination is assured and your election certain.</p>

<p>"With other candidate I fear the usual result: 'defeat.'
You have builded well; your ability will not allow you to
cease at the moment of your triumph. You stand upon the
banks of Rubicon. Empire is beyond, wilderness behind.</p>

<p>"Enemies delight in publishing your unalterable determination
not to be a candidate; your friends cannot even
say that you will accept the position if nominated.</p>

<p>"In the past, as in the future, I will trust in your patriotism;
and in your own due season, when the fruit be ripe, I
trust and know that you will not fail to gather the harvest
properly, honestly, and well.</p>

DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Chicago</span>, <i>December 23, 1883</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;It is clear to demonstration that Mr. Tilden
should be our nominee, and if he would consent to run,
that he would be again elected, this time by an overwhelming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[636]</a></span>
electoral as well as popular majority. From the moment
of the nomination to the close of the polls, the canvass
would be a triumphal progress. We should be obliged to do
some hard fighting, but always under the influence of assured
victory by fighting. The nomination and election
would not simply vindicate Mr. Tilden, but the right of the
people to elect their own officers. Nor is this all. If Mr.
Tilden would accept the nomination, that would relieve the
Democracy of all jealousy and heart-burning&mdash;all controversy
between rival candidates, all difficulty in the convention
or after the convention. Again, the platform could be carefully
drawn before the meeting of the convention, and ought
to be by Mr. Tilden himself. Since the days of Jefferson
and Franklin, this country has not had a statesman whose
pen could delineate so accurately and so simply a principle,
a policy, or a line of conduct. What the people need is
somebody who can tell them with accuracy and simplicity
just what they themselves think. This is the secret of Mr.
Tilden's great popularity with the masses, the existence of
which eminent jackasses in our party have often denied, and
do not seem to comprehend now that they are beginning to
be driven to concede it. There are always political prophets
(I don't mean to speak irreverently) looking for power in the
wind, or the earthquake, or the fire, instead of the still, small
voice. Now, the question of Mr. Tilden's health presents itself
about which I know absolutely nothing. His age is no
objection. Cato learned Greek at eighty, and Goethe completed
'Faust' after he had passed eighty. Taney and Shaw
delivered judgments when nearly ninety. Look at John
Quincy Adams and Gladstone and 'old Palm.' Why, Lord
Palmerston at the age of eighty saved his administration
by a masterly practical speech delivered without a note in the
early hours of the morning. And, speaking of him, McCarthy,
in his <cite>History of Our Own Times</cite>, commences the
chapter on the death of Lord Palmerston with the quotation,
'Unarm, Eros, the long day's task is done and we must
sleep.' Mr. Tilden's day has not been so long by eleven
years. Is his task done? The unfinished window in Aladdin's
tower must not remain unfinished. The art of prolonging
life lies in an object to be attained. I admit that various
things are to be taken into consideration as assisting in sustaining
health, and in that way prolonging mere existence;
but all these, while mere adjuncts to vegetation, really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[637]</a></span>
amount to nothing if there be not a sufficient object for living
outside of keeping one's self on this side of the river. I can
conceive of no higher object than the attainment of the Chief
Magistracy with the view of benefiting the people of this
Republic. Here I do Mr. Tilden justice. He is now at an
age when he doubtless feels that merely being President is
in itself vanity. That doll is stuffed with saw-dust, just
as all other dolls are found to be by all men, children of a
larger growth. But if he can, by being President, benefit
this people by saving their institutions, now in utmost peril,
by reforming the methods of administration, by teaching
both the great parties, and, in an especial degree, his own,
that adherence to principle is as desirable in a party as in
an individual, &amp;c., &amp;c., is that not an object worthy the
attainment of any man? And is it not an object that would
prolong life, and not bring it to termination? I am very
much mistaken if renomination, and election, and administration
would not do Mr. Tilden good. Of course, as the returns
came pouring in, there might be some hours of excitement
which possibly would lead to a reaction; but I think
not, as what is to be done would still lie ahead. The election
would simply give him the certificate, but his duty would
commence after the 4th of March. And here consider that
what hurried Harrison into his grave was probably office-seeking;
but that a man who could lug Roman consuls into
his inaugural address probably thought it necessary to listen
to every tide-waiter&mdash;a kindly but fatal error. I have seen
a suggestion in the papers which, by the way, might have
come from Mr. Tilden himself, which assigned to others
selected by the President the burden of administrative detail.
Certainly, in such particulars, my opinion is that Mr. Tilden
knows who to choose to carry out his ideas. The difference
between one man and another lies a good deal in the ability
to do work through others, and the sagacity to select them.
So far as the canvass or the administration is concerned, Mr.
Tilden would be benefited by both, and injured by neither.
As to the second place on the ticket, I think it should be
given Governor Hendricks. Napoleon said, 'Imagination
rules the world,' and you may depend upon it that sentiment
cuts no inconsiderable part in all elections. It must be
taken in solution, it is true, but it is a necessary ingredient.
Apart from the necessity of the 'old ticket,' it has great
strength because it <em>is</em> the old ticket. There is a certain sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[638]</a></span>
of justice that has gone unsatisfied since March, 1877, and
you blunt its edge if you change the ticket. Undoubtedly
Mr. Hendricks made a great mistake in 1880, but such mistakes
are often inevitable, and ought never to be irretrievable.
That he should now be in favor of the old ticket simply shows
that he wishes to reattain his old position in politics. His
error threw him out of the line, as everybody knew it would.
That he should desire to get back again is natural enough.
I thought yesterday you were entirely wrong in attributing
another motive entirely foreign to his character. Assuming
that the old ticket is to be nominated, and by acclamation, as
it would be, this would as readily happen at Chicago as anywhere
else. It is much better to have it done here than in
any Eastern city. The only doubt is, would it not be better,
partly as a matter of sentiment, to select St. Louis, and have
the same temporary chairman, committees, and so on, as in
1876, and the same platform, corrected by Mr. Tilden so
as to adapt it to the changes produced by lapse of time,
and to shape it on the subject of the defeat of the people's
will in 1876-7? So far as any other ticket is concerned,
Chicago is the place, and so far as the old ticket is concerned,
it is the place, except upon the ground above indicated.</p>

<p>"I have but little doubt that Mr. Tilden could carry this
State. It would need a good State ticket to ensure it. But
if it were known that the old ticket was to run, I think we
should get a good local ticket.</p>

<p>"Excuse the length of this letter and, if you can write me,
I wish you would.</p>

<p>"The compliments of the season to you and yours.</p>

<h2>CYRUS H. McCORMICK TO TILDEN</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Chicago, Ill.</span>, <i>April 7th, 1884</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I had a meeting of a few friends at
dinner at my house last Friday, some mention of which, I
trust, may not be entirely without interest to you. The
gentlemen present were Senator McDonald, of Indiana;
Mr. W. C. Goudy (member of National Democratic Committee);
Mr. F. H. Winston; Mr. Henry G. Miller; Mr.
Commissioner Mattocks; Mr. Perry H. Smith, Jr., and my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[639]</a></span>
son, all of this city. Judge Shepard, Mr. C. C. Copeland,
and Mr. Melville Fuller were invited but could not attend.</p>

<p>"My letter of the 27th of March addressed to yourself
was read to the gentlemen present and unanimously approved.
I had had a call from Senator McDonald the day
before, and had shown him a copy of my letter to you and
discussed the subject with him to some extent. He seemed
to think that 'the old ticket' (Tilden and Hendricks) would
take better in this State than <i>Tilden and McDonald</i>, seeming,
himself, not inclined to antagonize Hendricks on a ticket
headed by yourself; but, at the same time, he stated unhesitatingly
that, as a politician, in the ranks of the Democracy,
he felt himself subject to the orders of the party.</p>

<p>"There was a striking unanimity of sentiment between
the gentlemen present (except Senator McDonald) as to the
contents of my letter referred to, while our family physician
(a prominent Republican) remarked to me that the ticket
mentioned would suit him precisely, and that it would give
him pleasure to vote for it. An editorial article in the
<cite>Chicago Times</cite>, in speaking of the prospective Democratic
candidates, remarked that 'nobody wanted Mr. Hendricks.'</p>

<p>"Since the date of my letter to you, I have observed in
the papers very favorable comments by Horatio Seymour on
the subject of your health and ability to stand for a Presidential
nomination; and I have also observed sundry reviews,
by other parties, of the same character&mdash;perhaps in
all which it may be said that, while you are disinclined to
deprive yourself of your home comforts and enjoyments, you
have in no case been found to say positively that, if nominated
by the convention, you would not accept.</p>

<p>"I may add that Senator McDonald agreed heartily with
the other gentlemen present at our dinner party that <em>no
other name could command the support of the Democrats
of the country that yours would</em>.</p>

<p>"Under the circumstances, I beg to ask whether it would
be agreeable to your feelings or wishes that I should say
anything publicly in regard to the momentous issues briefly
referred to in this correspondence.</p>

<p>"I remain, my dear sir,</p>

<h2>HENRY C. SEMPLE TO TILDEN</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Gilsey House, New York</span>, <i>April 23d, 1884</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I regret that your business engagements
make it inconvenient for you to receive me for a few minutes,
as I am obliged to set out for home on Thursday evening,
and came on from Washington (where I have been in
attendance on the Sup. Ct.) principally to see you.</p>

<p>"You must be aware that the Democratic party will not
even consider the question of selecting among candidates
for the Presidency, unless satisfied that you will be incapable
of entering on the discharge of the duties of the office when
elected.</p>

<p>"Sensible men in the party will not ask that you <em>consent</em>
to be a candidate, nor will they regard the fact that you
decline to become a candidate.</p>

<p>"Those who wish to see the Republican party maintained
in power till we shall cease to have a Republican
<em>government</em> try to persuade the people that your health renders
it <em>impossible</em> for you to discharge the duties of the office.
Those in our own party, who look to their own interests
rather than to the good of the people, would also have us
believe this.</p>

<p>"Though comparatively a young man, I acted in 1848 as
secretary of a meeting of distinguished men in the Senate
who, indignant at Cass' answer in the question of slavery in
the territories, proposed to bring out another Democratic
candidate, so as to insure his defeat and teach the majority
of the party a lesson.</p>

<p>"They selected Littleton Waller Tazewell, of Virginia,
and addressed him a letter, asking that he should become a
candidate. I, as secretary, preceded this letter to him with
a private letter, assuring him that in addition to the names
of Yancey and others composing the committee, that the
movement would be supported by Jefferson Davis and other
leaders who would also write to him to urge his candidacy.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tazewell replied at once, saying substantially that,
while entertaining the same opinions, and cherishing the
same hopes expressed by the committee, he must decline to
allow the use of his name as a candidate, and that no
additional numbers, however respectable, would alter his
views.</p>

<p>"He advised them to select a candidate from another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[641]</a></span>
class; that the Priams of the party said that he could only
hope to last <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">telum imbellisim ictu</i>, etc., etc.</p>

<p>"In his private letter to me he said that, recognizing me
as the son of an old friend, he would say that, while old and
infirm (upwards of eighty, I think), he regarded it as the
duty of the citizen to serve the State when called on. That
Coriolanus had admitted this. That any man could say he
would not become a <em>candidate</em>, but no one could say he would
not <em>serve</em> the State.</p>

<p>"I am one of the few survivors of the patriotic but mistaken
associates who addressed that letter to Tazewell thirty-six
years ago. On his declination no further steps were
taken, and the matter was kept quiet. Some of them have
since filled high offices&mdash;one was afterwards a justice of
Supreme Court, New York, others Senators in Congress&mdash;places
which they would never have filled had this affair
become public. Had it become public it is possible that
Yancey's influence would have been so far impaired that
he would not have possessed the power, in 1860, to 'precipitate
the South into a revolution.'</p>

<p>"I thought that a history of this matter might be interesting
to you, and that I might draw some inferences from its
discussion with you which might enable me to render a
valuable service to the country. I believe that Hon. John
A. Campbell is the only man now living who could be compromised
in any manner by what I have said as to the correspondence
with Mr. Tazewell in 1848; but can rely, of course,
on your discretion for the preservation of a curious bit of
political history.</p>

"<span class="smcap">Chicago</span>, <i>June 7, 1884</i>.</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Hon. Samuel J. Tilden.</span>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The Republicans have now made their
nominations for President and Vice-President of men who
are fair representatives of the Republican organization.
Their election means a continuance of the partisanship,
abuses, corruptions, and centralizing tendencies of the last
twenty years which you and I both believe dangerous, and,
if continued, in the end destructive of Republican liberty.
It seems to me the patriotic duty of all men so believing to
sacrifice all personal considerations for their country's good.
The Democracy all over the land are looking to you as the
one person above all others to lead them in the coming
political contest. The only question seems to be: will you
consent to be the candidate? I know nothing of your determination,
except what may be gathered from the conflicting
statements of the press, and I do not expect or ask
a reply to my letter. My only object in writing is to urge
upon you the <em>duty</em> of yielding to the united demand of the
Democracy. There are times when patriots must not hesitate,
if necessary, to take their lives in their hands for
liberty's sake. I know not your physical condition, but
mentally you are all that your friends require; and even
at the hazard of your life, I believe it your duty to listen
to the united voice of the friends of constitutional liberty.
I <em>know</em> that you were once fairly elected President. I feel
confident that you can be again. Whether any other Democrat
can be is uncertain. I fear not. It was a great mistake
not to have nominated you four years ago. I felt it at the
time. The country now sees it. With the highest regard
for you personally, I beg of you to let us make you President
in fact.</p>

<p>Memoranda made by Charles O'Conor in conference with
Mr. Tilden and myself about Mr. Tilden's will, which his
brother Henry's death had made it necessary to remodel.
It was the last professional consultation O'Conor ever held.
He left New York the following day to return to Nantucket
(Thursday), and on Monday lay down upon the bed from
which he never rose alive. Before leaving New York, however,
he posted the following notes to Mr. Tilden:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Trusts cannot be created to receive and accumulate rents
or income of real or personal estate for any of the purposes
you have in view.</p>

<p>"You will be obliged to set off at once their shares or allowances
to your kindred out of your <em>capital</em>.</p>

<p>"The residue can be appropriated to such public purposes
as you may name to be created by the legislative allowance
within two specified lives after your death."</p></blockquote>

<p>"In my judgment, Mr. O'Conor was the greatest jurist

<p>"In variety of resources, in every form of experience,
participating in every important legal controversy during
fifty years, with unexampled power of discrimination and
memory, he had a vast mass of information on every professional
subject.</p>

<p>"He was a man of lofty integrity and honor, and scorned
all idea of making his professional abilities the means of
acquiring money.</p>

<p>"His character is worthy of a more elaborate tribute than
I have the opportunity to pay to him in the brief time of
your call."</p>

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The crime which defeated the will of the
people in 1876, and kept you from exercising the Presidential
office needs to be avenged.</p>

<p>"Time and your example have subdued and conciliated
all factious opposition to you in the Democratic party. The
opponents of former years are now your most noisy partisans.
Your nomination in July will follow as a spontaneous and
consentaneous act unless you prevent it.</p>

<p>"Preventing it calamitous consequences must ensue. The
Democratic party will be left to fall into strife, anarchy, and
impotency. The Old Guard and your old friends&mdash;what
will become of them? The barriers to latitudinous construction
will be broken down, and license given to public extravagance,
official corruption, and the greed of unscrupulous and
powerful monopolies.</p>

<p>"Your declination is inadmissible. Accept the nomination,
even if death should overcome you during or after
the fight. If I know myself, I would, in the present extremity
of country and party, suffer the martyrdom for you

<h2>JOHN A. McCLERNAND TO TILDEN</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Springfield, Ills.</span>, <i>June 6th, 1884</i>.</p>

<p>
"To His Excellency, <span class="smcap">Samuel J. Tilden</span>, President-Elect.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Respectfully reiterating everything I wrote
yesterday, I write again to-day to deprecate, if possible, still
more emphatically, but with all courtesy, any purpose on
your part to decline a renomination.</p>

<p>"I am aware that the question of acceptance has a personal,
as well as a political, aspect. I have given consideration
to both, though it may be not without prepossession.
The wish is often father to the thought. The grave matter
of health has already received my attention. Life, even
comfort, may well challenge our solicitude and care; still,
I am of opinion that both may be dutifully staked upon a
transcendent issue involving the welfare of a people. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dulce
et decorum est pro patria mori.</i></p>

<p>"What is the situation? The ruling party has overridden
the voice of the people, usurped their sovereignty,
oppressed the laboring classes by discriminating and unjust
taxation, and that as a means of perpetuating its domination
and enriching political adventurers. It would be worth the
life of the greatest and best man in the land to expel it from
its ill-gotten and abused places of power.</p>

<p>"In saying this, I am not unmindful of the memories of
the past: of the shameful persecution which the same party
wreaked on you, and of its unhesitating readiness to return
to its habitual vomit; nor of the ungrateful return formerly
made by recusant Democrats to your steadfastness and devotion,
but such has not unfrequently been the lot of other
public men of positive and decided qualities. Jefferson and
Jackson, your illustrious predecessors, did not escape it;
yet it is known and admitted that it detracted nothing from
their energy, usefulness, or merited renown. Persecution
and ingratitude are often the price paid for envied eminence
and superiority. But may I not say that the march of events
and opinion has raised you above the reach of harmful
malice: that it has reformed the sin of recusancy?</p>

<p>"I am persuaded that the rank and file of the Democracy
are with you, and are eager and resolute, under your leadership,
to vindicate their violated electoral rights and the
sanction of the ballot-box.</p>

<p>"Lately I was in Missouri, Arkansas, and Texas, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[646]</a></span>
I sought and conferred with a number of leading men, who
assured me on my representation that the Northwest was
almost, if not quite, unitedly in favor [of] your nomination;
they would heartily co-operate to effect it, and, indeed, while
I was in Texas, several districts passed instructions in favor
of it.</p>

<p>"As to the 'Old Guard,' although its ranks are thinned
and time has stricken it with age; although it can scarcely
hope to survive much beyond the impending contest, yet
its spirit is unbroken. It asks not office or emolument: it
covets only the post of duty and danger. It never surrenders:
it will stand by you whether for a nomination or
an election&mdash;for both it will keep the faith to the end. Will
you not lead it, as its tried, trusted, and honored chief,
to deliverance from the humiliation of unceasing contumely
and proscription?</p>

<p>"Upon the whole your refusal to lead the Democratic
masses would fall on them as a stunning and bewildering
blow. It would balk their welling expectations and overwhelm
them with disappointment. Would it not provoke a
reaction of feeling and opinion injurious&mdash;seriously injurious&mdash;to
both you and the country? I candidly think so.</p>

<p>"In conclusion, I assume, as I believe, that your nomination
would be followed by your election.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In spite of the earnest and almost oppressive urgency of
friends to whose counsels he was always anxious and usually
ready to defer, Mr. Tilden's consciousness of his lack of
strength for the work that would be expected of him if
elected President and ought to be required of him, did not
permit him to weaken in his purpose. It even hastened his
official termination of these importunities before the meeting
of the State convention, which had seemed to him the appropriate
occasion for any announcement that the four preceding
years had worked no change in the views previously
expressed of retiring from public life. The circumstances
which led him to anticipate by a few weeks what he regarded
as the fit time for such an announcement, I hope I
may be excused for giving, as I set them down at the time in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[647]</a></span>
my diary, premising that delegates from every part of the
State to the national convention were already appointed with
instructions, or with the understanding that they should
support Mr. Tilden for the nomination.</p>


<h2>D. MANNING'S APPEAL IN BEHALF OF CLEVELAND TO HAVE
TILDEN FORMALLY DECLINE BEING CONSIDERED
A CANDIDATE IN 1884</h2>

<p>"On or about the 8th day of June, 1884, Mr. Daniel
Manning, chairman of the New York Democratic State
Committee, called at my house in New York and asked me
to accompany him to Greystone to see Mr. Tilden. The motive
he assigned for his visit there, and for wishing me to
accompany him, was to persuade Mr. Tilden, if persuasion
should be necessary, to no longer delay the formal announcement
of his intention, well known to Mr. Manning and myself,
not to accept a renomination to the Presidency.</p>

<p>"Mr. Manning said while there was a hope, but no certainty
of Mr. Tilden's consenting to run, his friends, embracing
a large majority of the Democratic party of the
State, were getting divided as to their second choice, and
there was danger, when he came to withdraw, that the
party would be hopelessly distracted, and its influence in the
convention dissipated. He had been so impressed by a sense
of this danger, he said, that on the Sunday previous he called
on Governor Cleveland, laid the whole case before him, and
pressed upon his attention the necessity of doing something
immediately to prevent the friends of Mr. Tilden
from getting pledged to other candidates as their second
choice.</p>

<p>"On the following day we repaired to Greystone. Mr.
Manning then repeated to Mr. Tilden substantially what
he had said to me of his interview with Governor Cleveland
and of his mission, except that in regard to the cabinet. I
think he said, 'You can name any member of the cabinet
you please&mdash;an unobjectionable man, of course, like &mdash;&mdash;,
for instance' (naming a gentleman whom he knew Mr.
Tilden would regard as such a man).</p>

<p>"Though the general import of the conversation was that
the cabinet would be selected in harmony with Mr. Tilden's
wishes, I did not hear him state distinctly to Mr. Tilden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">[648]</a></span>
as I understood him to state to me in New York, that the
cabinet in its entirety should consist of men whose selection
Mr. Tilden should approve of. During that part of the
conversation with Mr. Tilden which I overheard, he said
that Mr. Tilden might name any member of the cabinet he
pleased, which might mean many or only one. This statement
was reinforced by the remark that Governor Cleveland
would do anything that he (Manning) should advise him
to do, for he was conscious that his only hope now was from
and through Mr. Tilden. The letter to Mr. Manning declining
a renomination appeared in the morning prints the second
or third day following the interview.</p>

<p>"He at the same time expressed his conviction that the
only way of securing the result was for Mr. Tilden to signify
at once and before the election of any more delegates to the
State convention, which were in the main to be chosen during
that week, that he would not be a candidate.</p>

<p>"Mr. Manning went on to say that Governor Cleveland
promptly and unhesitatingly authorized and expressed the
desire that Mr. Manning would go at once to Greystone,
represent the situation to Mr. Tilden, and give him any assurances
he required in regard to the naming of the cabinet,
and of his disposition and purpose to regard Mr. Tilden's
friends as his friends, and, if elected, to have as nearly as
possible a thoroughly Tilden administration.</p>

<p>"I said that I approved entirely of an early publication
of Mr. Tilden's intention not to allow himself to be made
a candidate. I believed a manifesto to that effect was already
written, but was withheld partly out of deference to
the wishes of some of his friends in Washington, and partly
for what seemed to be the more obvious and appropriate
occasion&mdash;the assembling of the State convention that was
to choose the delegates to the national convention; and finally
I promised to accompany him to Greystone."</p>

<p>"In my letter of June 18th, 1880, addressed to the delegates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">[649]</a></span>
from the State of New York to the Democratic national
convention, I said:</p>

<p>"'Having now borne faithfully my full share of labor
and care in the public service, and wearing the marks of
its burdens, I desire nothing so much as an honorable discharge.
I wish to lay down the honors and toils of even
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">quasi</i> party leadership, and to seek the repose of private life.</p>

<p>"'In renouncing renomination for the Presidency, I do
so with no doubt in my mind as to the veto of the State of
New York, or of the United States, but because I believe that
it is a renunciation of re-election to the Presidency.</p>

<p>"'To those who think my renomination and re-election indispensable
to an effectual vindication of the right of the
people to elect their rulers&mdash;violated in my person&mdash;I have
accorded as long a reserve of my decision as possible, but
I cannot overcome my repugnance to enter into a new engagement
which involves four years of ceaseless toil.</p>

<p>"'The dignity of the Presidential office is above a merely
personal ambition, but it creates in me no illusion. Its value
is as a great power for good to the country. I said four
years ago in accepting nomination:</p>

<p>"'" Knowing as I do, therefore, from fresh experience,
how great the difference is between gliding through an official
routine and working out a reform of systems and policies,
it is impossible for me to contemplate what needs to be done
in the Federal administration without an anxious sense of
the difficulties of the undertaking. If summoned by the
suffrages of my countrymen to attempt this work, I shall
endeavor, with God's help, to be the efficient instrument of
their will."</p>

<p>"'Such a work of renovation after many years of misrule,
such a reform of systems and policies, to which I would
cheerfully have sacrificed all that remained to me of health
and life, is now, I fear, beyond my strength.'</p>

<p>"My purpose to withdraw from further public service,
and the grounds of it, were at that time well known to you
and to others; and when, at Cincinnati, though respecting
my wishes yourself, you communicated to me an appeal
from many valued friends, to relinquish that purpose, I reiterated
my determination unconditionally.</p>

<p>"In the four years which have since elapsed, nothing has
occurred to weaken, but everything to strengthen, the considerations
which induced my withdrawal from public life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[650]</a></span>
To all who have addressed me on the subject, my intention
has been frankly communicated. Several of my most confidential
friends, under the sanction of their own names, have
publicly stated my determination to be irreversible. That I
have occasion now to consider the question is an event for
which I have no responsibility. The appeal made to me by
the Democratic masses, with apparent unanimity, to serve
them once more, is entitled to the most deferential consideration,
and would inspire a disposition to do anything desired
of me, if it were consistent with my judgment of duty.</p>

<p>"I believe that there is no instrumentality in human society
so potential in its influence upon mankind for good or
evil, as the governmental machinery for administering justice,
and for making and executing laws. Not all the eleemosynary
institutions of private benevolence to which philanthropists
may devote their lives are so fruitful in benefits as
the rescue and preservation of this machinery from the perversions
that make it the instrument of conspiracy and crime,
against the most sacred rights and interests of the people.</p>

<p>"For fifty years, as a private citizen, never contemplating
an official career, I have devoted at least as much
thought and effort to the duty of influencing aright the
action of the governmental institutions of my country, as
to all other objects. I have never accepted official service
except for a brief period, for a special purpose, and only
when the occasion seemed to require from me that sacrifice
of private preferences to the public welfare.</p>

<p>"I undertook the State administration of New York because
it was supposed that in that way only could the executive
power be arrayed on the side of the reforms to which,
as a private citizen, I had given three years of my life.</p>

<p>"I accepted the nomination for the Presidency in 1876
because of the general conviction that my candidacy would
best present the issue of reform which the Democratic majority
of the people desired to have worked out in the Federal
government as it had been in that of the State of New York.
I believed that I had strength enough then to renovate the
administration of the government of the United States, and
at the close of my term to hand over the great trust to a
successor faithful to the same policy.</p>

<p>"Though anxious to seek the repose of private life, I
nevertheless acted upon the idea that every power is a trust,
and involves a duty. In reply to the address of the committee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">[651]</a></span>
communicating my nomination, I depicted the difficulties of
the undertaking, and likened my feelings in engaging in it to
those of a soldier entering battle; but I did not withhold the
entire consecration of my powers to the public service.</p>

<p>"Twenty years of continuous maladministration, under
the demoralizing influences of intestine war, and of bad
finance, have infected the whole governmental system of the
United States with the cancerous growths of false constructions
and corrupt practices. Powerful classes have acquired
pecuniary interests in official abuses, and the moral standards
of the people have been impaired. To redress these evils
is a work of great difficulty and labor, and cannot be accomplished
without the most energetic and efficient personal
action on the part of the Chief Executive of the Republic.</p>

<p>"The canvass and administration which it is desired that
I should undertake would embrace a period of nearly five
years. Nor can I admit any illusion as to their burdens.
Three years of experience in the endeavor to reform the
municipal government of the city of New York, and two
years of experience in renovating the administration of the
State of New York, have made me familiar with the requirements
of such a work.</p>

<p>"At the present time, the considerations which induced
my action in 1880 having become imperative, I ought not
to assume a task which I have not the physical strength to
carry through. To reform the administration of the Federal
government; to realize my own ideal, and to fulfil the just
expectations of the people, would indeed warrant, as they
could alone compensate, the sacrifices which the undertaking
would involve. But, in my condition of advancing years and
declining strength, I feel no assurance of my ability to accomplish
those objects. I am, therefore, constrained to say,
definitely, that I cannot now assume the labors of an administration
or of a canvass.</p>

<p>"Undervaluing in nowise that best gift of Heaven&mdash;the
occasion and the power sometimes bestowed upon a mere individual
to communicate an impulse for good; grateful beyond
all words to my fellow-countryman who would assign
such a beneficent function to me, I am consoled by the reflection
that neither the Democratic party, nor the Republic
for whose future that party is the best guarantee, is now, or
ever can be, dependent upon any one man for their successful
progress in the path of a noble destiny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">[652]</a></span></p>

<p>"Having given to their welfare whatever of health and
strength I possessed, or could borrow from the future, and
having reached the term of my capacity for such labors as
their welfare now demands, I but submit to the will of God
in deeming my public career forever closed.</p>

</p>

<p>This letter of Mr. Tilden insured the nomination of
Grover Cleveland for the Presidency, and the adoption of
the following resolutions by the convention:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That this convention has read with profound
regret and intense admiration the statesmanlike and patriotic
letter of Samuel J. Tilden expressing the overpowering and
providential necessity which constrains him to decline a
nomination for the highest office in the gift of the American
people.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That, though fraud, force, and violence deprived
Samuel J. Tilden and Thomas A. Hendricks of the
offices conferred upon them by the Democratic party of the
nation in 1876, they yet live, and ever will, first in the hearts
of the Democracy of the country.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That this convention expresses a nation's regret
that this same lofty patriotism and splendid executive and
administrative ability which cleansed and purified the city
and State governments of the great Empire State, cannot
now be turned upon the Augean stable of national fraud and
corruption so long and successfully maintained by the Republican
party at the national capital.</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That copies of these resolutions be suitably engrossed,
and that the chairman of the convention appoint a
committee whose duty it shall be in the name of the convention
to forward or present the same to the Hon. Samuel
J. Tilden and the Hon. Thomas A. Hendricks.</p></blockquote>

<p>When these resolutions were presented to Mr. Tilden by
the committee named for that purpose by the convention, Mr.
Tilden sent them the following reply:</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Greystone</span>, <i>Oct. 6, 1884</i>.</p>

<p>
"<i>Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Committee</i>:
</p>

<p>"I thank you for the kind terms in which you have communicated
the resolutions concerning me adopted by the late
Democratic national convention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">[653]</a></span></p>

<p>"I share your conviction that the reform in the administration
of the Federal government, which is our great national
want, and is indeed essential to the restoration and
preservation of the government itself, can only be achieved
through the agency of the Democratic party, and by installing
its representative in the Chief Magistracy of the United
States.</p>

<p>"The noble historical traditions of the Democratic party,
the principles in which it was educated, and to which it has
ever been in the main faithful; its freedom from the corrupt
influences which grow up in the prolonged possession of
power, and the nature of the elements which constitute it,
all contribute to qualify it for that mission.</p>

<p>"The opposite characteristics and conditions which attach
to the Republican party make it hopeless to expect that that
party will be able to give better government than the debasing
system of abuses which, during its ascendancy, has
infected official and political life in this country.</p>

<p>"The Democratic party had its origin in the efforts of the
more advanced patriots of the Revolution to resist the perversion
of our government from the ideal contemplated by
the people. Among its conspicuous founders are Benjamin
Franklin and Thomas Jefferson; Samuel Adams and John
Hancock, of Massachusetts; George Clinton and Robert R.
Livingston, of New York; and George Wythe and James
Madison, of Virginia. From the election of Mr. Jefferson
as President, in 1800, for sixty years the Democratic party
mainly directed our national policy. It extended the boundaries
of the Republic, and laid the foundations of all our
national greatness, while it preserved the limitations imposed
by the Constitution and maintained a simple and pure system
of domestic administration.</p>

<p>"On the other hand, the Republican party has always
been dominated by principles which favor legislation for the
benefit of particular classes at the expense of the body of the
people. It has become deeply tainted with the abuses which
naturally grow up during a long possession of unchecked
power, especially in a period of civil war and false finance.
The patriotic and virtuous elements in it are now unable to
emancipate it from the sway of selfish interests which subordinate
public duty to personal greed. The most hopeful
of the best citizens it contains despair of its amendment
except through its temporary expulsion from power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[654]</a></span></p>

<p>"It has been boastingly asserted by a modern Massachusetts
statesman, struggling to reconcile himself and his
followers to their Presidential candidate, that the Republican
party contains a disproportionate share of the wealth,
the culture, and the intelligence of the country. The unprincipled
Grafton, when taunted by James the Second
with his personal want of conscience, answered: '<em>That is
true, but I belong to a party that has a great deal of conscience</em>.'</p>

<p>"Such reasoners forget that the same claim has been made
in all ages and countries by the defenders of old wrongs
against new reforms. It was alleged by the Tories of the
American Revolution against the patriots of that day. It
was repeated against Jefferson and afterwards against Jackson.
It is alleged by the conservatives against those who, in
England, are now endeavoring to enlarge the popular suffrage.</p>

<p>"All history shows that reforms in government must not
be expected from those who sit serenely on the social mountain-tops
enjoying the benefits of the existing order of things.
Even the divine Author of our religion found His followers
not among the self-complacent Pharisees, but among lowly
minded fishermen.</p>

<p>"The Republican party is largely made up of those who
live by their wits, and who aspire in politics to advantages
over the rest of mankind, similar to those which their daily
lives are devoted to securing in private business.</p>

<p>"The Democratic party consists largely of those who live
by the work of their hands, and whose political action is
governed by their sentiments or imagination.</p>

<p>"It results that the Democratic party, more readily than
the Republican party, can be molded to the support of reform
measures which involve a sacrifice of selfish interests.</p>

<p>"The indispensable necessity of our times is a change of
administration in the great executive offices of the country.
This, in my judgment, can only be accomplished by the
election of the Democratic candidates for President and
Vice-President.</p>

<h2>GEORGE HOADLEY TO TILDEN</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">State of Ohio, Executive Department</span>,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Columbus</span>, <i>November 22, 1884</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;On the occasions of my last two visits
to New York, I was unable to command the time to go to
Greystone, so that I did not, during the canvass, have the
pleasure of expressing my hopes and anticipations to you
with reference to its progress in Ohio, or of exchanging congratulations
with you upon its apparently favorable prospects.
Now, however, we may rejoice over results, and you
are especially to be congratulated. At last a Democratic
administration takes possession of power: most fortunately,
one whose chief has been trained in New York and has sat
at your feet and studied his Democracy in the school of Van
Buren and Silas Wright. Your judgment that Ohio was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[660]</a></span>
not to be trusted is vindicated. I confess I thought differently.
I underrated the forces of corruption, and especially
of the money that could be brought to bear. You judged
more wisely, and the event proves it. Indeed, I saw this
before the Chicago convention, and with my full approval
my friends there labored for Governor Cleveland's nomination,
and by dividing Ohio made it possible.</p>

<p>"I was asked by telegram during that convention if I
would accept the Vice-Presidency. I answered in the negative,
my ambition being in the line of our profession and
to be a busy man, not an idle man. As I said to you when
we last met, I should like to be Attorney-General. If that
cannot be, I am content to remain as I am or return to
private life.</p>

<p>"There are some other facts connected with this matter
which I should be glad to lay before you in person had I the
opportunity, but which cannot well be committed to writing.</p>

<p>"I take it for granted that your wishes will have great
weight with the President-elect. I should esteem it the
success of my life, more valuable than the office itself, to
know that you approve, or do not disapprove my ambition,
and wish my appointment. I would rather be <em>your</em> Attorney-General
than hold any office in the Republic short of the
highest, and as the value of that lies in being <em>your</em> choice
and having your confidence in a place wherein something
may be done to give effect to your principles an equal importance
attaches to your recommendation to your successor.
But while I am ambitious, I am not greedy or insubordinate.
Your disapproval of my ambition would be law to me.
You are the honored head of our party, and I am ready as
a loyal soldier to submit to my commander in this, not
grudgingly, but cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Please take this matter into consideration, and at your
convenience let me know your thoughts.</p>

survey of the situation than I can have, and that he must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">[662]</a></span>
bear the chief responsibility of failure. As I said in my
former letter, I am too good a soldier not to take orders cheerfully
and obey them ungrudgingly.</p>

<p>"My dear Mr. Tilden, if I had had the least doubt of
your esteem and regard I should not have written you as
I did or as I do.</p>

<p>"You intimate a doubt whether you will be consulted by
President Cleveland with reference to his cabinet. This
disturbs and distresses me. To begin by ignoring you, especially
if the men whose timidity and self-seeking sacrificed
you and the cause in 1877 are taken into confidence, would
be a sad prophecy of disaster to come. A statesman can get
along, sometimes, by selfishly disregarding considerations of
gratitude to the elements that made him&mdash;in other words, by
kicking down the ladder by which he has climbed; but if
he add to this the closing of his ears to the wisest and most
far-seeing of his counsellors he is lost. The new administration
may perhaps safely throw Ohio overboard, although our
fight here in October made success in November possible,
as the national committee has fully acknowledged to our
State committee; the new President may perhaps safely turn
his back upon the men who risked their own political lives
to save his at Chicago, but it will be a sad day for him and
for his government if he ignore you and do not seek your
counsels.</p>

<p>"The circumstances to which I alluded as not to be written
are well known to Mr. Smith M. Weed and to Mr.
William L. Scott (I think) and possibly to Mr. Daniel
Manning.</p>

<p>"I have the honor to be,</p>

<h2>SAMUEL J. RANDALL TO TILDEN</h2>

<h3>(SENATOR BAYARD'S PLANS)</h3>

<p>The following Associated Press despatch appeared at
about this time:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When Senator Thomas F. Bayard came to Albany and
paid his respects to President-elect Cleveland, it is understood
that he left for home with the assurance that he could
make his choice of any position in the cabinet, and he would
receive the appointment. It is said on good authority that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">[663]</a></span>
after having duly deliberated over the matter, the Delaware
Senator sent a note to the Governor, which was received
yesterday, indicating his preference for the portfolio of
Secretary of the Treasury. It is rumored that he will be
accordingly appointed."</p></blockquote>

<h2>ROBERT M. MCLANE TO TILDEN</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Executive Mansion, Annapolis, Md.</span>, <i>Dec. 29th, '84</i>.
</p>

<p>"My dear Governor,&mdash;I wish you a happy New Year,
and I would be delighted if I could offer my greeting in
person. I would do so if I knew when you were to be in the
city, or if it would be quite convenient to drop in on you
at 'Greystone,' as I am going to pay a New Year's visit to
my sister, Mrs. Hamilton, at Poughkeepsie.</p>

<p>"I have not heard from any of my New York friends
since the election, and I can see little from the bottom of my
well here. I saw Mr. Randall in Washington on Saturday
just as he was starting for Kentucky, and was sorry to hear
from him that he had expressed the wish that his name
should not be associated with any cabinet appointment, for
though I appreciate his disinterestedness, no man in the
country is better able than he to dispel all distrust in Connecticut,
New York, New Jersey, and Indiana when we
come to deal practically with the revision of the tariff. He
could and would easily reduce duties and increase revenue,
ridding us forever of excise taxation! We are, it seems to
me, in very nearly the same fix we were in under Jackson
and Polk, when we drove the high Protectionists and Free
Traders into one camp in opposition to a revenue tariff!
Under Polk, Governor Marcy brought from New York the
experts employed by Mr. Walker in the Treasury, who gave
the maximum revenue duty upon every article imported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">[664]</a></span>
under the Whig Tariff of 1842. We could raise now over
$300,000,000 by applying the same principle, greatly increasing
the revenues, and to the advantage rather than to
the injury of our industries. Mr. Randall is able to do this,
and none of the doubtful States would distrust him. If we
do not find such a solution of this question our victory will
turn to ashes on our lips! Once more wishing you a happy
New Year, and many returns thereof, I remain,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Gross</span>,&mdash;I regret that the temporary obstruction
to your hearing, and the weakness of my voice, made
the interview which I accorded you of so little utility.</p>

<p>"I have felt obliged to adopt a rule, thus far adhered to,
to write no letters to Mr. Cleveland making any recommendations
or requests in regard to appointments which may
come within his gift. I intend not to volunteer any advice
to him on that subject, and, if consulted in any case, I do
not design to become a partisan of any one of my numerous
friends who may desire his favor, but only to communicate
with judicial impartiality such information as I may possess,
and such opinions as I shall have formed concerning
each of the competitors.</p>

<p>"It seems to me that your prospects of being selected
for some such office as you desire will depend mainly upon
the extent and character of the support which you may receive
from your own locality.</p>

<p>"It can better be judged of, when the cabinet shall have
been formed, whether and to what extent you may require
extrinsic help.</p>

<p>"I need not say that I regard your connections with great

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Geo. W. Smith.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">"My dear Governor</span>,&mdash;I saw C. (Cleveland) on Saturday
(yesterday) A.M., and talked from 10.30 to 12.30
with him. He was just as he was when I saw him last, and
talked very <em>freely</em> to me. He is absolutely with <em>our</em> friends
in sentiment. Has some queer ideas, which can all be
talked out of him, I think. I told him what you said about
his civil service letter, and it pleased him immensely. I told
him about your financial work and talked over that subject
with him, and it made an impression, and he seemed very
anxious about it and thankful that you sent J. on to W.
He spoke of anticipating seeing you in N. Y., but I did
not say anything about his going to visit you. He will
not give B. (Bayard) anything but Secretary of State, and,
I think, <em>thinks he better stay in the Senate at that</em>. He is
very set on <em>Whitney,</em> and I think has no one else but that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667">[667]</a></span>
could be changed. He spoke of regretting both B.'s and
G.'s leaving the Senate. He talked very freely and frankly,
and I do not think it has hurt him to let him alone for
a couple of weeks, as he has been.</p>

<p>"I saw Manning a moment and told him he nor C. had
acknowledged your invitation. He seemed surprised, and
said he understood that he sent word to you this eve., and
I think C. understood that M. had done so both for himself
and C. I told him I did not so understand him. He said to
write you to-day that C. was <em>all right in every way</em>. That
he spent the entire evening with him on Friday, and that
among other things he talked with him about going to see
you. That C. said he had agreed to go to N. Y. and listen
to those who wanted to talk to him, and that he should go
Feb. 1, or within a day or so of it, one way or the other.
That he should simply hear what they had to say, and should
make no committals in any way; and that after he had heard
them, he and M. should go to you. C. told M. that was
his idea of the best way to do it&mdash;if agreeable to you. I
think he said that C. insisted upon his going to N. Y. with
him. They therefore will visit you the last of the first
week in Feb'y&mdash;if nothing happens. I had a very hasty
talk with M., as I had but five minutes before my train
started. I think I ought to say that C. has considerable
<em>dread</em> of A. H. G. (Andrew H. Green). He said G. abused
every one and found fault with everything, and evidently
had an idea that G. represented to some extent your views.
I undeceived him about that. I found M. feared that G.
would get hold of his letters to you also, and that, <em>I think</em>,
is one reason why M. likes better to send messages than to
write, although he probably learned that from you. I do
not know as I should have written the above about <em>G.</em>, <em>but
thought</em> you ought to know it.</p>

<p>
<i>"Private and confidential.</i></p>

<p class="sig">"<span class="smcap">Washington City</span>, <i>Feb'y 1st, 1885</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Tilden</span>,&mdash;On the day after my return
to New York from Greystone, I had a conversation with Mr.
Jones as to the fusing of himself and his political associates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">[668]</a></span>
in regard to the appointment of Mr. Manning as Secretary
of the Treasury.</p>

<p>"Mr. Jones spoke, very decidedly, for himself and Mr.
Horace White, in favor of the appointment, and was of
opinion that it would meet the approval of all the leading
independents, especially in view of the fact that such an appointment
was, probably, the only means by which the danger&mdash;as
he characterized it&mdash;of Mr. Whitney's accession to that
office could be avoided. He represented that he and his
friends were opposed to the appointment of the last-named
gentleman to any place in Cleveland's cabinet.</p>

<p>"He requested me to say to you that, in his interview with
Mr. Cleveland on Sunday last, he stated to him that, but for
your course, in reference to him, he certainly would never
have been nominated&mdash;and that he impressed upon him the
extent of his obligations to you.</p>

<p>"In all that he said&mdash;as far as I am informed&mdash;on this
subject he was right, and would have been right had he gone
further and given the President-elect a broader view of the
situation.</p>

<p>"<em>But for you</em>, and the wonderful power and wisdom with
which you conducted the Democratic party up to and through
the campaign of '76, the rule of the Republican party would
have remained unbroken for another quarter of a century.</p>

<p>"You <em>regained</em>, <em>preserved</em>, and have <em>transmitted</em> a political
estate to Mr. Cleveland, and from what I know of his
intellectual and moral character, cannot believe that he will
fail to appreciate this condition and history. I cannot believe
that he will&mdash;in the great emergency which is upon
him&mdash;fail to avail himself of your wise counsel and advice;
or that he will, in looking back upon the events of '76 and
those which followed, allow those of your friends who were
with you in your triumph, and then led the forlorn hope in
the desperate fight of that hour of darkness and treachery, to
be pushed aside now by the unscarred sycophants around him.</p>

<p>"The impression seems to prevail here that, since the
election of Evarts, it would be very unwise to withdraw
either Bayard or Garland from the Senate.</p>

<p>"We will, certainly, be overmatched in debate in that
body, whether the gentlemen referred to remain or not.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Governor</span>,&mdash;Unless my information is sadly
at fault, and I have reason to believe it is not, your old
enemies, who conceived the electoral commission to cheat you
out of the Presidency, are making both active and insidious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">[670]</a></span>
efforts to install themselves in President Cleveland's cabinet.
To be frank, Mr. Bayard and Mr. Thurman, who were your
rivals for the Presidential nomination, and who originated
the infamous tribunal which defrauded not only yourself
but the American people of their just rights, are both using
tremendous forces to gain cabinet places. Mr. Bayard wants
the Treasury portfolio, in which desire I have reason to believe
he will fail. In such case, he will take the State Department.
Thurman will be content with any designation.
His candidacy is covertly in the interest of Pendleton. This
you may know and doubtless do.</p>

<p>"I have reason to believe you will have the opportunity,
quite soon, to give your well-matured views as to public men
and public policy to the President-elect. I know too well
that our mutual friend, Mr. Bigelow, holds justly your highest
appreciation. So he does mine. Still, the purpose of
my letter, without detracting at all from Mr. Bigelow's
merits, is to call your attention to an old and tried friend of
your own and myself. Governor Robert McLane, of Maryland,
I have in my mind's eye. He is an old friend of
thirty years' standing. He is a radical Democrat. I know
he has always been your conscientious and personal friend
and admirer. He has had large and ripe public experience,
both as a diplomat, a legislator, and the executive of his
State. His grandfather was an officer in the war of the
Revolution. His father was distinguished for all those traits
which make true Democracy illustrious. He was a member
of Congress, a U. S. Senator from Delaware, Minister to
England, Secretary of the Treasury, and Secretary of State.
For ten years he was the president of the Baltimore &amp;
Ohio Railroad Co.</p>

<p>"To go back to the son. You know as well as I his public
service. Jackson appointed him to West Point. In the
Florida war he served with credit; also under General Scott
in the Cherokee country. In 1847 he began his Congressional
term, representing a Maryland district, and subsequently
in 1849. President Pierce, in 1853, appointed him
a commissioner to China with full powers plenipotentiary.
In 1859 President Buchanan appointed him Minister to
Mexico. He was again elected to Congress in 1879 and
1881, and is now the Governor of Maryland, being elected
by 12,000 majority.</p>

<p>"Don't you think, Governor, it would be only fair to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671">[671]</a></span>

<h2>DRAFT OF A LETTER TO THE HONORABLE HUGH MCCULLOCH,
SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Greystone, Yonkers, N. Y.</span>, <i>February 11, 1885</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. McCulloch</span>,&mdash;I am much obliged for the
kind attention you gave to my inquiries. I have been delayed
in writing to you my acknowledgments, from the lack of
leisure to add some observations which I desired to make.
And if compelled to differ with you in any respect, I need
not say that it is with a high and respectful appreciation
of your opinions and abilities in finance.</p>

<p>"I agree that a currency strictly limited in amount so
as not to exceed, but rather to be less, than the effective
demand for necessary public use, may be kept in circulation
at a rate higher than its intrinsic value. But that is true
only on very stringent conditions.</p>

<p>"As to making a market for silver coin by withdrawing
bank-notes and treasury notes of less denomination than five
dollars&mdash;and ultimately of less denomination than ten dollars&mdash;there
are grave difficulties. In your letter it is remarked:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'You say that fifty millions of silver is about all that the
country can absorb. This is true; and it is true simply because
we keep in circulation upwards of fifty millions of
one and two dollar notes. If these notes were withdrawn,
their place would immediately be filled with silver and
gold. If the five-dollar notes were also retired, all of the
silver dollars now in the Treasury vaults would be in circulation,
as they ought to be. On this point, permit me to
call your attention to page 34 of my report. I wish you
could see your way clear to use your great influence in favor
of the retiring of the one and two dollar United States
notes, to be followed in due time by the retirement of all
notes below ten dollars.'</p></blockquote>

<p>"The habits of the people, and their unanimous and
strong preference for the portable currency of paper over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673">[673]</a></span>
the cumbrous currency of silver, interpose an almost insurmountable
obstacle to such a measure. Borrowing the
idea from the practice of England, and supported by most
economical writers, that measure has been often advocated,
and sometimes attempted to be put in practice. But the
expedient has never made much progress, and it has been
resisted and rejected by the people at every opportunity.</p>

<p>"About fifty years ago a law was passed, by the State of
New York, suppressing bank-notes of a less denomination
than five dollars. Although in my general views friendly to
free banking, I justified myself in supporting the measures
on the ground that it was legitimate to apply an artificial
restraint to an artificial system. Enclosed is a copy of the
resolutions drawn by myself, opposing the repeal of that law.</p>

<p>"On that issue, more than on any other single question,
the party of Jackson and Van Buren was overthrown in the
State of New York in the election of 1838. William L.
Marcy was defeated as a candidate for re-election as Governor,
and 'Small-Bill' Seward was elected in his place.
The law was immediately repealed. The question had some
special disadvantages at that time; but the indications of the
popular wishes were unquestionable.</p>

<p>"I understand from members of my family, that ladies
shopping at retail stores in New York city almost universally
refuse to take silver dollars. Even one silver dollar is considered
an incumbrance, is, in fact, too large to be carried
in a ladies <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">porte-monnaie</i>, while several of them are quite out
of the question.</p>

<p>"I understand, also, that our small notes are very popular
in Canada, and in the Bahama Island, being preferred to
silver coin.</p>

<p>"I think that the best way of making a market for silver
through the small circulation, is for the government to receive
the silver at its intrinsic value, and to issue certificates
against it dollar for dollar.</p>

<p>"Among your observations on the question of the expediency
of making the nominal value of the silver dollar
correspond to its intrinsic value, it is suggested:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"'Another objection might be that the adoption of this
standard would probably operate to prevent joint action, by
the leading commercial nations, in fixing a ratio of silver to
gold which would be concurred in by all nations; and, perhaps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">[674]</a></span>
thus delay or frustrate that which would seem to be
very desirable. No legislation by the United States alone,
would be effectual in fixing the rules of silver outside of
its own boundaries. Joint action of the principal powers
appears to be the only mode through which a satisfactory
solution of the question can be reached.</p>

<p>"'If there is no hope that such an arrangement can be
made, it would be desirable that the intrinsic value of the
silver dollar should be brought so nearly as possible to its
nominal value.'</p></blockquote>

<p>"After looking over the discussions of the last two International
Conferences, I cannot avoid the conclusion that
it is hopeless to make any further attempt to obtain the co-operation
of the leading commercial powers in fixing a ratio
between gold and silver coins, and that the contingency in
which you would deem it 'desirable that the intrinsic value
of the silver dollar shall be brought as nearly as possible
to its nominal value,' has already occurred.</p>

<p>"These two statements are for different periods. The
results, therefore, are not exact. They afford, however, the
basis of a conjecture as to the actual condition of the Treasury.
Although the amount really belonging to the Treasury,
and over which it has permanent control, is very much reduced,
I presume it ventures to use, for temporary purposes,
temporary balances liable to be drawn at the will of other
parties and trust funds, upon the assumption that the balances
are likely to remain about the same, as a bank uses its
deposits.</p>

<h2>TILDEN TO SMITH M. WEED</h2>

<p>
"<i>Confidential.</i></p>

<p class="sig">
"<i>Feby. 13/85.</i>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Weed</span>,&mdash;I understand from you that Mr.
Manning hesitates about accepting the Treasury. You may
tell him for me that I do not think he is quite a free agent
in the matter.</p>

<p>"Mr. Manning will recollect before the State convention,
and when he wanted my aid in carrying the delegation, he
went to New York, and got Mr. Bigelow and came up to
see me. He stated to me and to Mr. Bigelow that he came
at the request of Mr. Cleveland, and was authorized to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">[676]</a></span>
to me any assurance which he might deem necessary. He
said that in case of Mr. Cleveland's election, I should have
a practical influence in the selection of the cabinet, and
particularly should name a member from the State of New
York. The only qualification was that the men should be
of good cabinet material, and he instanced Mr. Bigelow
as a specimen and type of the sort of man to be recommended.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>"My friends had particularly wished that I should not
publish my letter of declension until after my name had
been presented by the State convention; they wished this as
a matter of delicacy, and also as a matter of feeling. My
letter had been written with that view. Mr. Manning
stated that Mr. Cleveland thought it would do him good to
have my letter published in advance. I had no personal
interest in the nomination, but a desire for the success of
the Democratic party and for Mr. Cleveland's administration;
that his success would be of real value to the country,
and that the local chieftains who had reorganized the Democratic
party on a reform basis, and renovated its moral power
before the country, should be cherished and continued as instruments
of public good. I acceded to Mr. Cleveland's
wish, sacrificed the preference and pride of my friends,
and gave my letter to the press immediately. I also aided
what I could at so late a period, in selecting delegates to
the State convention.</p>

<p>"Mr. Manning came again to me prior to the national
convention, and asked for authority to communicate my
judgment and wishes to friends from other States. It is
well known that most of the delegates had been elected
either with express instructions, or with the understanding
that they were to vote for my nomination, and it was not
doubted that if I did nothing, the nomination would have
been conferred on me without dissent.</p>

<p>"The circumstances lent weight to my advice as to who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">[677]</a></span>
should be nominated. I authorized Mr. Manning to communicate
to my friends from other States that, while I could
not assume to dictate to the Democratic party, my judgment
was in favor of nominating Mr. Cleveland. Mr. Manning
said this intimation would be sufficient.</p>

<p>"He communicated it to many of my friends among the
delegates from other States. In addition to this, he gave
assurances, in behalf of Mr. Cleveland to the delegates from
several States, that the administration should be made up
from those who had been my supporters, and who transferred
their adhesion to Mr. Cleveland.</p>

<p>"If now the cabinet should be made up largely, and almost
exclusively, from men who were hostile to Mr. Cleveland's
nomination, and unfriendly to the veterans in all the
localities who had created a new success for the Democratic
party a cabinet of rivals of Mr. Cleveland, self-seekers who
would be devoted to their own schemes instead of building
up Mr. Cleveland's administration, it would not only weaken
the administration, but chill the masses with a sense that
their leaders had turned their back upon their followers to
whom they were indebted for everything.</p>

<p>"Mr. Manning cannot afford, by any act of omission or
commission, to be responsible for such a result. Unless he
accepts the Treasury, I am not mistaken in the belief that
the veterans will have no true and reliable friend among
the advisers of Mr. Cleveland.</p>

<p>"On public ground, also, the Secretary of the Treasury
ought to be taken from the State of New York. He ought
to be in communication with the most intelligent and experienced
men in the centre of finance and commerce. He
ought to be a man who can command ready access to, and
have confidential relations not with speculators and gamblers,
but with the solid men of property and business.</p>

<p>"Next to Mr. Manning, if he should refuse&mdash;which, I
think, he has no right to do&mdash;Mr. Bigelow is the best substitute.
He is an accomplished man, accustomed to deal
with great public questions, utterly unselfish and unambitious,
without any tendency to inferior associations, and
would command the confidence and support of the financial
classes.</p>

<p>"But I still adhere to the opinion that Mr. Manning
cannot avoid accepting the trust which sacrifice, duty, and
honor toward the Democratic masses demands at his hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">[678]</a></span></p>

<p>"In discussing thus frankly this subject, I serve no interest
personal to myself. My career is completely ended.
If the new administration should drift out of relations to
those who have given me special support during the last ten
years, I should be liberated from all care and trouble, should
escape generating discontent among any portion of the Democracy,
and should preserve the almost unanimous favor
enjoyed by me when I retired from public life. To invite
the antagonisms of active politics without the power to submerge
them by shaping a policy which should appeal overwhelmingly
to the people, would be to impair the repose
and comfort for which I have surrendered all public honors.
I cannot be induced to meddle at all, even in the way of
private advice or opinion, except under the influence of
patriotic and friendly motives.</p>

<p>"You may read this letter to Mr. Manning, but keep
it and return it to me.</p>

"Yours truly."

<p>
<i>"Confidential.</i></p>

<p class="sig">"<i>Feby. 16, 1885.</i>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Governor</span>,&mdash;I had but a moment to write you
from A. (Albany). C. (Cleveland), as you know, had
offered the (State Department) to Bayard, and he had become
convinced that it was wise to offer a place to Lamar.
We relied upon him and upon Manning until we got that
fixed with both&mdash;that left three places. We all agreed that
Frank Jones was our best man in New England, and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679">[679]</a></span>
got that to a practical point, the only question being, where
would he go? I wanted him to have the Navy, but C. seemed
disposed to give him the P. O. That left two places open.
Scott and Gorman both agreed with me that, on the free-trade
question, Vilas was not a good appointment. Cleveland,
on the other hand, wants him, and I think, in the end,
will select him for War or P. O. Then came McD. (as
he would not appoint Dr. Miller, for reasons that I will
tell you when I see you, and which are personal to M., and
in no way show any indisposition to go back on his backers),
and Scott, G. (Gorman), M. (Manning), and myself all
urged Converse for a place instead of McD. He almost
consented to it. I did it upon the ground that if Vilas
went in, he had to put in some one who stood with Randall
on the tariff, or the consequences would be bad in this State
and New Jersey and Connecticut. When we left him last
night, he was apparently of our mind. This A.M. he wanted
to know of me if I did not think that Whitney, in McDonald's
or Converse's places, would be a good change. I told
him that W. was infinitely preferable to McD., but I thought
W. and C. were much better than V. and McD., as all the
rest were inclined to free trade except Manning. He has
an idea that he should not put any M. C. in who has taken
strong grounds on tariff either way; but I told him Lamar
had, and Vilas was an out and out free-trader, and Bayard
was like Lamar.</p>

<p>"Gorman, who really wants Jones instead of Lamar, says
that there will be no trouble with Lamar; that it is his
nature to go with his chief, and he will be loyal. That
Bayard is so constituted that he will not try to influence
Lamar, and that he will not set up for himself, while Garland
will always be true to you and your friends. As I
wrote you, Cleveland wants Whitney, and I think it will
be a good thing for your friends that he should go in with
Manning.</p>

<p>"This is just as the matter stands to-day. I told him
this A.M. that I will, if desired, come down again, etc., and
as he did not ask me to stay, I am going home. I would have
gone to New York had not Mrs. Weed been quite ill and
really needs me; and, again, I did not care to have C.
(Cleveland) get the idea that I was taking the result of the
conference to you. He has, by our advice, gone seriously
into the preparation of his Inaugural Address. I am delighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">[680]</a></span>
that M. (Manning) has consented to go in. Some
able, bright man should be selected for his solicitor, and at
least two others for his assistants. I infer you will see M.
(Manning) ere long.</p>

"<span class="smcap">Greystone</span>, <i>March 1, 1885</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Manning</span>,&mdash;1. I have advised Mr. Jordan
that he must not assume to advise you as to government
policy. He can be useful in doing particular things under
direction, and in furnishing such information as he may
have, or as he shall be specially delegated to obtain, but must
not undertake to advise on important matters. He must not
expect to be appointed to a confidential position in your
department. You can recompense his service in some other
way. He has some knowledge which is capable of being
made useful, but his talk is cloudy and confused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681">[681]</a></span></p>

<p>"2. I think you must move very slowly in changing important
subordinates. The impression seems to exist that
French must go sooner or later. I do not think Coon should
be changed right away, if at all.</p>

<p>"3. Mr. Fairchild is rather technical, but is entirely trustworthy.
You might put him in French's place, and let him
get the run of the department, which is a very large and
complicated concern, while the other officers, who are experienced,
will be there to give information and to carry on
the routine. Both yourself and Mr. Fairchild can judge
better what changes are desirable after you have got acquainted
with the men and their capabilities, and with the
functions of their several offices, and shall have ascertained
your own wants in respect to assistance.</p>

<p>"4. I hear a Mr. Gilfillen highly spoken of, but I have
no personal knowledge of him.</p>

<p>"5. I send you a letter of Senator Gibson, who is entitled
to consideration. Please return it to me when you

<p>
<i>"Private and confidential.</i></p>

<p class="sig">"17 <span class="smcap">Dupont Circle, Washington, D. C.</span>, <i>Mch. 8/85</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am dreadfully embarrassed financially,
and, although very reluctant, seek employment in the
government, since I see no other way open to me as a means
of livelihood. I have rendered the Democratic party some
service. You, perhaps more than any one else, know and
appreciate the work I have done during the past ten or
twelve years. I came to Washington comparatively unknown
to all the public men of the country save Judge
Black. Grant's first term was just closing, and jobbery and
fraud were rioting in every department of the government.
At considerable personal peril, and with inevitable social
ostracism to myself and family, I began the work of exposing
rogues and roguery, rascals and rascality. You signalized
your life by overthrowing the Tweed ring, and destroying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682">[682]</a></span>
those who organized it and profited by its robberies.
You exposed and broke up the canal frauds. You were
rich and powerful politically, but you know how potent
those whom you brought to grief were to do you injury.</p>

<p>"My first work in Washington was to assail the Navy
ring, and to make known the jobs and frauds by which the
Navy had been ruined, and millions of dollars stolen from
the public treasury to enrich contractors. I followed this
work systematically for years, and I do not exaggerate when
I say that the country would not have a realizing sense to-day
of the way its Navy has been destroyed and its Treasury
robbed of hundreds of millions if my work had not been
done.</p>

<p>"The first Democratic House of Representatives after
the war was elected chiefly because of the exposure of the
Credit Mobilier fraud and other disclosures of jobbery
which resulted from my work. I broke up the Shepherd
ring in this city and drove out the robbers. For eight years
I labored without intermission to destroy the Star Mail-route
ring, and finally made it possible to bring the guilty
to punishment. That the result was a scandal upon, and a
perversion of, justice was no fault of mine. That I was deprived
of the credit due me for exposing the frauds never
grieved me, because I was not working for glory, but to make
good government possible. What I did to bring to just
punishment the authors and abettors of the great fraud of
1876, and to make forever odious that great crime, you
know.</p>

<p>"That I have incurred the hostility of many and excited
the envy of still more is but the natural sequence of the
work I have done. Politicians are not prone to remember
those who made their success possible, unless you are a present
potential factor. Of course, in all that I did I had a
fearless newspaper with a great circulation as an engine
to work with. But I created, in no small degree, the power
I used and the influence I exerted. When I began my
work here the <cite>Sun</cite> had only a <em>local</em> circulation and a <em>local</em>
reputation. It secured, largely through my work, a <em>national</em>
circulation and reputation. It profited largely by my
work, while I received only a modest salary and fell heir to
all the enmities provoked.</p>

<p>"Pardon me for wearying you with this long letter, but
of all the Democrats I know you are the only one upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683">[683]</a></span>
whom I feel that I can rely for some appreciative exertion
in my behalf, now that the party, in whose faith I was born,
and for which the best years of my life, and the best energies
of my poor abilities have been exerted, is in power. I know
I am not egotistical when I say that I know more of the
inner workings of the government than any man in Washington.
I have, for nearly fourteen years, made every department
of the Federal government a close study. I know
where and how the jobs and frauds have been worked, and
how the rottenness can be exposed, and, moreover, can point
out the defects of the Treasury system which made many of
these possible. I could be invaluable in many ways here,
but I would prefer a quiet place abroad. I confess that I
am not <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en rapport</i> with many of those who are likely to be
most influential with the administration. My tastes are
naturally literary, and I have been at work for several years
upon the history of the last four months of Buchanan's administration.
I have a book of 600 pages nearly ready for
the press, the principal data for which I got from Judge
Black. The preparation for this work naturally led me to
study closely and carefully the political history of the
United States, so I could succinctly and graphically deal
with the course which led to the Civil War. Becoming
deeply interested in the subject, I began writing <cite>The Political
History of the United States</cite>. I have nearly completed
the first draft of the first volume of this work, and I want
the means and leisure to complete it. The place of all others
which I would like, and which would enable me to have the
resources at hand, would be the Consul Generalship to London;
but I presume that it is useless to aspire to that. Some
one with more social and political influence than I can command
will get it. But I think that I might aspire to be
Consul at Liverpool. That place was given to Packard, of
Louisiana, as the price of his yielding gracefully to the
Hayes Commission, which, in pursuance of the <em>bargain</em>
made with Southern Democrats in 1876, went to Louisiana
to install the Nichols government. Inasmuch as I contributed
largely to make the work of that commission odious,
and to have the Returning Board indicted and convicted, I
think it would not be presumptuous to claim Packard's
place.</p>

<p>"May I not ask you to take more than an ordinary interest
in my behalf? My lifelong friend, who knew me from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_684" id="Page_684">[684]</a></span>
childhood, and who always took the deepest interest in my
welfare, is no more. You esteemed him at his true worth.
You know how emphatic he always spoke in my behalf. If
Judge Black was alive, he would join heartily in any effort
to secure me the place I seek. But I know no one now, save
yourself, to whom I can appeal. There are possibly a <em>few</em>
who would damn me with faint praise.</p>

<p>"I know how many there are who will importune you,
and that there are others with more and better claims upon
you; but I am sure that none <em>needs</em> your good offices more,
and that none will appreciate them higher than</p>

<h2>TILDEN TO GOVERNOR D. B. HILL</h2>

<h3>(THE BROADWAY RAILROAD BILL)</h3>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Greystone</span>, <i>April 21, 1885</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Gov. Hill</span>,&mdash;1. The bill entitled 'An act to annul
and dissolve the Broadway Surface Railroad Company'
is a very proper and necessary bill.</p>

<p>"2. The bill entitled 'An act to provide for the winding
up of corporations which have been annulled and dissolved
by legislative enactment' does not seem to me to contain
any deceptive or dangerous promises, and may be deemed
unobjectionable.</p>

<p>"3. The bill entitled 'An act in relation to the consents
of property-owners, order of the general term confirming
reports of commissioners, and the consents of local authorities,'
&amp;c., preserves, notwithstanding the repeal of the charter:
<em>first</em>, the consent of the property-owners abutting on the
street to be occupied by the railroad; <em>secondly</em>, the consent
of the local authorities having control of the street or highway
to be occupied by the railroad; <em>thirdly</em>, the order of the
general term confirming the report of any commissioners
that such railroad ought to be constructed or operated.</p>

<p>"This bill fails to protect the public from dangerous
abuses, with the experience of them in the case of the Broadway
Railroad before our eyes.</p>

<p>"It is known that the consent of the local authorities was
obtained by bribery. Yet this bill provides that that consent
shall be valid and effectual.</p>

<p>"It is known that the general term appointed improper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_685" id="Page_685">[685]</a></span>
persons as commissioners to decide whether or not the Broadway
Railroad ought to be built.</p>

<p>"It is known that the general term confirmed the report
of those commissioners in favor of having the road built
by the grantees without regard to the fact that the compensation
to the city from the grantees was grossly inadequate.</p>

<p>"In the case of the Cable Railroad grant, the same general
term refused to confirm the report of the commissioners
on the express ground that the compensation to the city
from the grantees was inadequate.</p>

<p>"Yet this bill adopts, by legislative act, the consent of the
local authorities obtained by bribery.</p>

<p>"It also adopts the action of the general term which was
at least improvident and unjustifiable in face of its later
action in the cable case. The appointment of commissioners,
and the confirmation of their report, was a substituted consent
in behalf of the property-owners. The direct consent
of the property-owners could probably not have been obtained.</p>

<p>"The substituted consent was obtained only by the abusive
action of the general term.</p>

<p>"Again, the effect of this bill is to deny to the people, to
the local authorities, and the property-owners interested
any opportunity to pass fairly upon the question, whether
or not Broadway should be occupied by a surface railroad;
it practically determines that there shall be a surface railroad
in Broadway.</p>

<p>"The only question which it leaves open is, Who shall
own and operate that railroad?</p>

<p>"In my judgment, this bill ought to be held under advisement,
after the two former bills have been acted upon.</p>

<p>"You will thus have opportunity for mature consideration,
and for manifesting your vigilance in protecting the public
interest.</p>

<p>"It is very possible that you will come to the conclusion
to withhold from it your approval.</p>

<p>"That is my judgment of what ought to be done.</p>

<p>"I have dictated this letter, after reading, this evening,
the newspapers, and finding out as well as I could what
has been done to-day. I will endeavor to write about the remaining
bill to-morrow.</p>

<h2>TILDEN TO BIGELOW</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Greystone</span>, <i>May 2, 1885</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Bigelow</span>,&mdash;I send you the two addresses.
Do not cut them. Carefully preserve them. If lost, I
probably could not replace them.</p>

<p>"1. The address to which I referred in the account, I
gave of it to you, is entitled 'Address of the Democratic
Members of the Legislature of the State of New York.'</p>

<p>"The first part of it contained on the first and second
pages, and a part of the third page was, I think, drawn by
John Van Buren, and prefixed after the preparation of the
main body of the document.</p>

<p>"One of the passages written in by me while revising a
part of the address will be found on pages 11 and 12. It
is marked.</p>

<p>"2. On the subject of adapting a colonial system, or entering
into a partnership with mixed races, you will find a
declaration in the address of February 16, 1848, pp. 8 and 9,
and also in a resolution on p. 16. They are marked.</p>

<p>"I should like to know of exactly what use you propose
to make of them. After you have read both papers, I should
like it if you could run up here for half an hour and talk it
over.</p>

<h2>TILDEN TO DANIEL MANNING</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Greystone, Yonkers, N. Y.</span>, <i>June 9, 1885</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Manning</span>,&mdash;I am sorry to hear that the
President has been unwell. Having invoked Mrs. Manning's
influence in favor, in your case, of a reform of the
excessive and destructive sway of the 'interview' evil, I
regret that there is no Mrs. Cleveland to co-operate in this
reform in the case of the President. He starts with an admirable
constitution, but there is a limit to what even he
can endure.</p>

<p>"Paper recommendations are a poor reliance at best. A
regular trial on a paper basis, of fourth-class postmasters, is
beyond the strength of any one man.</p>

<p>"It is necessary that the appointing power should find
out friends in every locality, who can be trusted to give accurate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687">[687]</a></span>
information and conscientious advice, and put the
responsibility on them, and then accept their judgment.</p>

<p>"It is a mistake to suppose that the party leaders are not
capable of being extremely useful as means of intelligence.
A party is a living being, having all the organs of eyes,
ears, and feeling. No man can rise to leadership without
having some qualities of value. The appointing power
should not be governed absolutely by local leaders; but
should hear them in important cases, cross-examine them,
derive all the benefits they are capable of rendering, and not
be ambitious of displaying a disregard of them. Distrust
of one's friends will generally result in misplaced confidence
in inferior persons or in ill-advised action.</p>

<p>"The importance of the little postmasters is very great.
In many of the purely rural districts there is one to every
hundred voters. They are centres of political activity.
They act as agents and canvassers for the newspapers of
their party, and as local organizers.</p>

<p>"The immense power of this influence is now wholly on
the side of the Republicans. To allow this state of things
to continue is infidelity to the principles and cause of the
administration. The wrong should be gradually corrected.</p>

<p>"I send herewith some extracts from the letters of Mr.
Jefferson, both because the view taken by him is sound, and
because he had a felicitous mode of statement, which is a
good example to his successors when they have occasion to
discuss the same subject.</p>

<h2>FRANK McCOPPIN TO S. J. TILDEN</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">The Pacific Club, San Francisco</span>, <i>June 9, 1885</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The Chinese question has again disturbed
the people, or some of them, upon this coast; but this time
it came to us in a new form, as the printed matter enclosed
will explain.</p>

<p>"At one time the President intended to appoint a Californian
Minister to China (he offered it to Mr. S. M. Wilson
of this city), but changed his mind later; hence the present
disturbance.</p>

<p>"In this so-called interview I mention the names of all
the members of the cabinet save one, and that one I do not
admire. A very witty friend of mine, the late John B.
Fetton, once said, in regard to very old case cited by opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688">[688]</a></span>
counsel, that it was like ox-tail soup&mdash;it came from
too far back. And so it appears to be with Mr. Secretary,
judging by his late performance in Kansas; he comes from
too far back. You will, I hope, pardon me for addressing
you in this apparently flippant manner; but, though
new to you as a correspondent, I am a very old friend of
yours, and served on the national committee (Democratic)
from 1872 until 1879, when I resigned in consequence of
having to go to the Sandwich Islands. Therefore, I served
through the campaign of 1876, when this State was lost to
us, and the Presidency to you, by a stupendous fraud committed
in this city.</p>

<p>"Mrs. McCoppin is a New-Yorker, was a Van Ness, and
a niece of the late Mrs. Roosevelt, 836 Broadway.</p>

<p>"Before leaving Washington, I wrote Mr. Manning, who,
I suppose, will pay no heed to me, pointing to the fact that
our Southern friends in California are pressing forward,
to the exclusion of all other classes, for <em>all</em> the Federal
patronage upon this coast. In this city we have 51,000
registered voters, 2400 of whom are from the South; and
yet the 2400 want <em>all</em> the offices, and I suppose they will get
them.</p>

<p>"The Gwin clique alone have more than enough to fill
every place.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Smith</span>,&mdash;No one can regret much more
than I do the composition of that railroad list of officers.
I had supposed that in view of what I said as to Mr. Canda
that I would hear more of the case before final action, but
in this I was disappointed. Two, and possibly three, of the

given them. Hoadley, it appears (I did not see him), was
over here on some business of his own, just in the nick of
time to be consulted, and the result was what might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690">[690]</a></span>

<p>The following is the letter mentioned in the above note:</p>


<h2>&mdash;&mdash; TO DANIEL MANNING</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, <i>July 12th, 1885</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Secretary</span>,&mdash;I have a piece of news for you,
which I can only hope will not annoy you as much as it has
some of us here. You will remember that on one of my
visits to the Hot Springs, I told you that some of the gentlemen
of the department had organized a social club, and
out of respect and admiration for you had named it 'The
Manning Club.' Well, the organization seemed to be a
vigorous and thriving one, and we had in it almost every
Democratic chief of bureau and chief of division in the
department. We had rented a fine house for a year, had
partly furnished it, and were rapidly getting into good shape
when a bomb-shell fell among us in the shape of a notification<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_691" id="Page_691">[691]</a></span>
of the displeasure of the President, and now the organization
is completely disorganized and about ready to
disband.</p>

<p>"So far as we can learn, the President was misinformed
of the objects of the club; he was told that it was a political
organization; but even when its real purpose, that of promoting
good feeling and good fellowship among Democratic
officers of the Treasury Department, was explained to him
by Judge Maynard, he insisted upon continuing his disapproval;
and intimated that if the organization were continued,
he would write a letter for publication, denouncing
it and kindred organizations. This I learn from persons
who talked with him about it.</p>

<p>"Of course, under the circumstances, there is nothing for
us to do but disband. The president of the club wrote Mr.
Cleveland, asking for an interview at which he might explain
to him its purposes. This was on Friday last. To-day
(the 12th) he received a note from Colonel Lamont
saying that the President referred the writer of the letter
to Mr. Fairchild, to whom he (the President) had spoken
on the subject.</p>

<p>"I had a talk with Mr. Fairchild the other day, and
found that he had been misinformed as to the objects of the
club; but even after I had explained its purpose to him, and
while he acknowledged the legitimacy of that purpose, he
expressed disapproval of it as liable to misconstruction, and
apt to become a source of embarrassment to the administration
because of the political qualification for membership.</p>

<p>"The matter is all the more annoying, because there is
treachery at the bottom of it. Mr. Fairchild tells me that
on Wednesday evening last he heard of it and went to the
President about it, and that he found the President already
knew of and disapproved of it, as he then understood it.
Judge Maynard, who saw the President on Friday, and
explained the real purposes of the club to him, tells me that
on Wednesday morning he was informed by Colonel Youmans
that the club was disapproved of by the President.
Youmans thus appears to have been the first person in the
Treasury to know that the club met with disfavor at the
White House. He knew of it Wednesday morning. On
Tuesday night his name was proposed for membership in
the club, and the person who proposed his name said he had
talked with the chief clerk about the organization that day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692">[692]</a></span>
(Tuesday). It is hard to think it possible, but almost every
member of the club believes that Youmans carried the information
he had concerning the club and his own impressions
of its purposes to the White House.</p>

<p>"However, the club is now a thing of the past; or will be
as soon as we can close up its affairs and dispose of our
house and furniture, and that part of the incident is at an
end; but what puzzles all of us is that a social club of Democratic
officials should be vetoed, while State Democratic associations,
with purposes assuredly partisan, continue to flourish
in Washington.</p>

<p>"I do hope, Mr. Secretary, that the matter may not annoy
you or cause you any embarrassment, but I am fearful that
it will. I did not write you on Friday, because I wanted to
wait and see how it would turn out. It is proper that I
should write you about it, now that the President has refused
to have the matter explained to him by our officers,
and that we have determined to disband."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Shortly before the receipt of the letter which follows, Mr.
Manning, one day on leaving the cabinet, experienced an
apoplectic attack which compelled him to be transported to
his home, and was destined, I believe, to prevent his ever
placing his feet again in the Treasury Department. As soon
as he was able to travel, he repaired to Albany, where he was
accustomed to find the comforts and consolations of home,
and expected in seeking them again to be speedily restored
to health. In this, however, both he and his friends were
disappointed; and though he survived until December of
'87, he early realized that his illness was incurable, and that
his public career, so full of promise, was ended. In the
latter part of July he was invited by Mr. Tilden to join
him at the Kaaterskill House in the Catskills, where Mr.
Tilden himself was temporarily sojourning. To this invitation
the following was Mr. Manning's reply:</p>


<h2>DANIEL MANNING TO S. J. TILDEN</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">153 Washington Avenue</span>,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Albany, N. Y.</span>, <i>July 26th</i> (<i>1885.</i>)
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Governor</span>,&mdash;I have read and carefully
thought over your letter of the 16th inst. Dr. Hun and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_693" id="Page_693">[693]</a></span>
Dr. Simons are agreed as to the heart, the examination of
the urine, and the necessity for careful attention to diet.</p>

<p>"I think that I should much like to go to the Catskill
Mountains, but I doubt if I would be comfortable there without
the company of some cheery friends. I am now under
engagement to go to the Watch Hill House, Watch Hill,
R. I., next Thursday. Chancellor Pierson, a gentleman of
great good-humor, talkative, and a jolly disposition, undertakes
to go along. We may spend a couple of weeks there,
and then I shall be at the end of my rope.</p>

<p>"I want to see you very much to talk about my proposed
communication to the President. I feel more and more,
daily, that I need your assistance. Have you thought over
the matter? Have you prepared a form for me? Do you
know when our friend will return from Europe? I should
feel much more at ease if everything was ready in advance.
I do not know when I can get to see you. It occupies a day
to go from Watch Hill to New York or Yonkers, and for
me the trip will be a long one. Kindly clear my mind on
this point. I do so much want to decide on my action before
the vacation closes. That done, I should feel comparatively
free.</p>

<p>"My health is improving daily. My physician talks encouragingly,
and I feel that I am better, stronger, than I
was when I left Greystone.</p>

papers you gave me, the other day, some memoranda on the
following questions, it would help me out a great deal.</p>

<p>"1. Would not the expense of deepening the canal, so as
to add two feet to the depth of water, be very great? I
understand that now, for a great part of its course, the bottom
of the canal is composed, for about a foot depth, of
clay and hydraulic cement packed closely, so as to prevent
leakage; and would not the expense of taking this up and
replacing it, after the bottom was dug up, be more serious
than any calculation has yet allowed?</p>

<p>"2. How far does the fact that the lake transportation
has almost entirely passed into the hands of railroad people,
affect the probability of increasing the business of the canal,
in case it should be deepened?</p>

<p>"3. Can the canal be maintained in the face of the increasing
railroad competition?</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Uncle Samuel,</span>&mdash;Yours of yesterday received
this morning. In reply, would say that I am sorry you had
gained the impression that I was intending to seek a position
on the State ticket this fall, for such a thing was far
from any intention of mine. When this matter was first
brought to my notice, by an article which appeared in the
N. Y. <cite>Graphic</cite>, some time since, I immediately requested a
friend of mine, who is connected with that paper, not to
refer to the matter again, as I was not a candidate, and
would not accept a place upon the State ticket. This same
answer I have always given whether spoken to upon the
subject, and had so thoroughly dismissed it from my mind
that it did not occur to me to speak of it when I saw you
two weeks ago. I have always made our business here of first
importance and politics secondary, working at the latter when
time would permit. I appreciate only too fully the position
in which one is placed who has only a political life before
him with all its uncertainties to desire such a one, having
seen so many in this position.</p>

<p>"Had I thought of such a step I certainly should not
for one moment have entertained it until I had spoken to
you upon the subject, for I have appreciated and can easily
understand the complications which would arise. Will come
up to Greystone the first opportunity I have, and explain
more fully than I can write. With many kind regards, I
remain,</p>

<h2>NOTES ON THE CANAL</h2>

<h3>[<i>Written by Mr. Tilden on September 4-5, 1885, in Answer to Queries
on the Subject by Mr. Dana.</i>]</h3>

<p>"<i>Q. 1.</i> Would not the expense of deepening the canal,
so as to add two feet to the depth of water, be very great?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_696" id="Page_696">[696]</a></span>
I understand that now, for a great part of its course, the
bottom of the canal is composed, for about a foot depth, of
clay and hydraulic cement packed closely, so as to prevent
leakage; and would not the expense of taking this up and
replacing it, after the bottom was dug up, be more serious
than any calculation has yet allowed?</p>

<p>"<i>A.</i> The idea of increasing the depth of the canal two
feet is a gross exaggeration of what is possible or proper
to do.</p>

<p>"To build up the banks two feet would necessitate building
up the locks. To excavate the bottom two feet would
be impracticable.</p>

<p>"At page 23 of my Message for 1873 it was stated:
'The waterway was practically never excavated in every
part to its proper dimensions. Time, the action of the elements,
and neglect of administration all tend to fill it by
deposits.' There is no doubt that the sides of the waterway
have been changed, and the slope filled in with silt, narrowing
the bottom of the canal, so that it is only in the middle
that the proper depth is approached, and inconvenience is
felt in one boat passing another.</p>

<p>"My suggestion was to bring up the canal to an honest
seven feet. All the structures of the canal were adapted to
that. 'Bring it up to seven feet&mdash;honest seven feet&mdash;and
on all the levels, wherever you can, bottom it out; throw the
excavation upon the banks; increase that seven feet toward
eight feet, as you can do so progressively and economically.
You may also take out the bench-walls.'</p>

<p>"This suggestion looked to gaining on the long levels,
when it was found practicable, some inches increasing seven
feet '<em>toward</em>' eight feet. The suggestion was carefully
limited, because in many places you cannot change the bottom
without interfering with culverts, or carrying the excavation
below the mitre sills of the locks."</p>


<p class="center"><i>As to the Capacity of the Erie</i></p>

<p>"The lockages at Frankfort, during the season of 1884,
were 20,800.</p>

<p>"The lockages in 1873 were stated on page 22 of my
Message of 1875 to have been 24,960.</p>

<p><br />"The railroads have competed successfully with the Erie
Canal, and have carried off all the increase in the tonnage.
Notwithstanding the State has ceased to charge tolls, and
has imposed an annual tax of $700,000 upon the taxpayers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_698" id="Page_698">[698]</a></span>
to maintain the canals. The Erie Canal has failed to keep
up its business. It holds on to a portion of the lumber, and
of the grain.</p>

<p>"There seems to be no probability that the Erie Canal
will regain any portion of the business it has lost.</p>

<p>"None of the grand schemes by which it is proposed to
enlarge or improve it can, to any appreciable extent, cheapen
the transportation. They will simply waste the money of
the taxpayer, and revive the system of contracting, jobbery,
and fraud.</p>

<p>"The advantage of lengthening the locks so as to pass
two boats at once, when there is plenty of time to pass four
times the boats which the tonnage requires, is doubtful, and
is at least inconsiderable. It can only pretend to save five
minutes in a lockage, if, in fact, it will save any time.</p>

<p>"Unless some effectual expedient be adopted to prevent
the waste of water in locking through a single boat, it would
consume three times as much water in the long lock as in the
short lock. I understand that the superintendent thinks
that ruinous mischief can be avoided, but I have had no
means of testing how the thing would work in practice.</p>

<p>"In 1867, when I examined the subject, I found that on
the Delaware and Raritan they used boats of about the same
dimensions as the boats in use on the Erie, notwithstanding
the locks were capable of passing two boats at a time.</p>

<p>"I send my Message of 1875; my speech in the Constitutional
Convention in 1867, which contains a fuller discussion
of the subject. I send, also, the last report of the Superintendent
of Public Works on the canals.</p>

<p>"The statistical tables are so changed from the ancient
forms that it is difficult to get the materials for a satisfactory
comparison of the present with the former business.</p>

<p>"A certain portion of the business naturally belongs to
the railroads. The principles which govern this division are
set forth in the beginning of my speech in 1867. The business
would naturally be divided, and the share of the railroads
would be increased as the network of the railroads is
perfected, and more and more points are touched.</p>

<p>"Besides, the railroads will compete for additional business
at less than cost, charging the loss upon the paying portion
of their traffic.</p>

<p>"On the whole, it must be observed:</p>

<p>"Within the last ten years the cost of transportation by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699">[699]</a></span>
railroad has been reduced one-half. All the improvements
tending to cheapen transportation are made by the railroads.</p>

<p>"As to the clamor about diverting traffic to the Canadian
lines, it is senseless. The great mass of grain brought from
the West is for local consumption. Two millions and a half
of people residing in the city of New York and its suburbs
are not going to bring the grain for their own consumption
by way of Montreal. A large share of the flour and grain
carried by the New York Central is for local consumption
in New England. Formerly it came to New York city, and
was distributed from that point. It is now carried direct.
For instance, flour and grain, for consumption at Springfield
and Worcester, are carried from the point of shipment
in the West direct to those places without change of cars.
They cannot be diverted.</p>

<p>"The Erie Canal still has a certain utility. It should
be nursed along, but without any expectation of regaining the
place it once occupied in the transportation of the country.
The taxpayers of this State will not always consent to pay
a bonus of $700,000 per year in order to get tonnage for
the Erie Canal."</p>

I leave my farm to drive over to Utica about once in a week.
If I get into your section of the State I shall be happy to
call upon you. I do not keep track of current events. I
went to the convention about our canals. I was nominally
its chairman; but I presided only a few minutes, as I was
too deaf to hear. My attendance harmed me. I have not

<p>"To His Excellency, <span class="smcap">Grover Cleveland</span>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Mr. D. A. McKnight, the law clerk in
the Patent Office, is the author of a book of great ability
entitled <cite>The Electoral System of the United States</cite>.</p>

<p>"Without adopting all of his views, his independence, integrity,
and conscientiousness are shown by the fact that
his masterly analysis of the doings of the electoral commission,
in which he exposes the inconsistencies of their decisions,
and condemns them as illegal and unconstitutional, was published
in a volume printed in 1878, with a preface dated
March 10, 1877. At that time Mr. McKnight was holding
his present office under the administration of Mr. Hayes.</p>

<p>"I understand that his resignation has recently been requested,
in order to give the appointment to some other person.</p>

<p>"Mr. McKnight is confessedly an excellent officer, serving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_702" id="Page_702">[702]</a></span>
the government with fidelity and skill; and is personally
free from every objection.</p>

<p>"Under these circumstances, I take the liberty of appealing
to you for an intimation in favor of the retention of
Mr. McKnight, or his promotion to a higher grade in the
service.</p>

<p>"The Democratic party of the United States have beheld,
with indignation, the chief agents in the frauds, perjuries,
and forgeries by which a pretext of documentary evidence
was furnished on which to base a false count, rewarded by
their appointment in numerous cases to most important civil
trusts.</p>

<p>"It would scarcely be anticipated that a Democratic administration
should have so little sympathy with, or respect
for the popular feeling on this subject as to discard a
meritorious officer having the peculiar claim to its recognition
which the facts I have narrated show Mr. McKnight
to possess.</p>

<p>"I have no personal interest in the matter, but consider
it my duty to represent the cause of public justice, to the
end that the crime against the people consummated in 1876,
and again meditated in 1884, shall never be repeated.</p>

<h2>MARSHALL PARKS TO S. J. TILDEN</h2>

"<span class="smcap">Norfolk, Va.</span>, <i>14 Dec., '85</i>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Hon. S. J. Tilden, Greystone, N. Y.</span>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your letter to Hon. Mr. Carlisle on the
subject of our coast defences has been published in our
papers, and I can assure you were read with great interest.</p>

<p>"The change in the mode of warfare has rendered a number
of our forts almost useless. I would call your attention
to those near this city&mdash;Fortress Monroe and Fort Wool
(formerly Fort Calhoun). The former is said to be the
largest for defence in the world, and the latter on an artificial
island, one mile distant, not yet completed; both
designed to protect Hampton Roads, James River, Norfolk,
and the U. S. Navy-Yard here. As they are only one mile
apart, I presume it was about the range of guns at the time
they were designed. Modern ordnance renders this structure
of <em>no value</em>, and it is likely it never will be completed, and
I write to suggest the importance of its removal to another
location, which will, I think, make it a defence for the
capital as well as Baltimore, Norfolk, Richmond, and other
cities. By reference to the map of Chesapeake Bay, you
will observe there is a shoal between Cape Henry and Cape
Charles called the <i>Middle Ground</i> on which a modern fort
could be erected from the material now useless at Fort Wool.
This fort is built on an artificial island having a base of
fourteen acres, in water from twelve to fifty feet deep, entirely
of rough granite. This could be removed at little cost,
and a modern structure of iron or steel erected on it, with
necessary fixtures for torpedo service.</p>

<p>"Just inside Cape Henry is Lynn Haven Bay and river.
The river would make an admirable station for torpedo-boats,
as it is a safe harbor, completely landlocked, and may
be connected by a few short and inexpensive canals with
Back Bay, Currituck, Albemarle, and Pamlico sounds which
may extend the inland route to Florida at little cost.</p>

<p>"Several years ago I made the voyage from New Berne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_704" id="Page_704">[704]</a></span>
North Carolina, to Oswego, New York, <em>in the same steamer,
going inland the entire way</em>! I have spent many years on
this inland project. By the construction of two short canals
(only fourteen miles) we have opened up to commerce 1800
miles of navigable waters. I am now about to open a canal
from Neuse River to Beaufort Harbor, North Carolina,
which will be a continuation of the inland navigation. It
would cost but little to make an inland water route to
Florida, as a few short canals would unite the natural waterways
existing, and the inland route would then be complete
from the Great Lakes to Florida, passing by all our great
seaboard cities.</p>

<p>"As we have now no defence to our national capital, I
have thought a line from you at this time would bring it to
the favorable consideration of Congress.</p>

<p>"If you have not the charts convenient, I would be pleased
to furnish them and any further information desired.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Bancroft</span>,&mdash;I have received a copy of your
<cite>Plea for the Constitution of the United States</cite>, which the

<p>"I note your strong impression of your sense of the importance
of the theme, when you say you 'have thought it
right to bestow upon it many of the few hours that may remain
to you for labor.'</p>

<p>"To the eyes of your countrymen, those hours grow more
valuable as they become fewer.</p>

<p>"As an argument your <cite>Plea</cite> is overwhelming.</p>

<p>"Indeed, until new lights recently dawned upon the court,
and upon some others, in all our national history it had been
universally considered as axiomatic that Congress had no
constitutional power to make anything but gold and silver
a legal-tender. That conclusion was always assumed when
the subject was incidentally alluded to. Forty years ago, in
a speech in the constitutional convention of the State of
New York on the subject of Currency and Banking (Tilden's
<cite>Public Writings and Speeches</cite>, Vol. I., p. 222), I
recognized the disability of any government in this country,
State or Federal, to make a legal-tender of anything but
gold and silver.</p>

<p>"In all the literature of political economy, of currency
and banking, this postulate was taken for granted.</p>

<p>"It is a long time since I have had the pleasure of seeing
you or Mrs. Bancroft. I was gratified at the account of
you, which I received from my nieces who recently visited
Washington. I hear that you have lit up your household

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Sibley</span>,&mdash;I have received your interesting
letter. The newspapers are correct in saying that the 9th
of February is my birthday, but some of them are quite
astray in saying that I am seventy-nine years old. I was
born the 9th of February, 1814, and was seventy-two years
old on my last birthday. Although seven years younger than
you are, I can readily believe that you are practically
younger than I. You have not done so much as I to exhaust
the vital powers, and have not so large a debt to pay
for strength borrowed and consumed in advance. My eyes
are extremely good, and enable me to pass most of my time
in reading; my ears are both of them much more acute than
those of most people. The doctors tell me that every vital
organ is in strong and sound condition. But I have been
for some years greatly annoyed by a mysterious malady of
some of the nerves of motion, which imparts a tremor to my
hands, and impairs my voice so that I lose most of the pleasures
of conversation.</p>

<p>"I have also read the brief biography of your life and
doings which you were kind enough to send me. It illustrates
an example of an active, useful, and successful career.</p>

<p>"Wishing you every blessing of continued health, and
prolonged years of happiness and prosperity,</p>

<p class="sig">

<h2>"ACCOUNTABILITY OF CORPORATIONS<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></h2>

<p>"The governmental policy of the State of New York has
been a long while established, that charters of corporations
within its jurisdiction, carrying on business for profit,
should be subject to alteration or repeal in the discretion of
the Legislature.</p>

<p>"The Revised Statutes of 1830 applied that rule to corporations
thereafter to be created. A reservation of that
power had been previously inserted in the special charters
which had latterly been granted. The origin of this reservation
was ascribed in an article asserting the repealability of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_709" id="Page_709">[709]</a></span>
corporate charters, written by Mr. Tilden for the <cite>Democratic
Review</cite> of August, 1841 (Tilden's <cite>Writings and Speeches</cite>,
Vol. I., p. 171), to Silas Wright, who procured the insertion
of such a reservation in a charter granted in 1822.</p>

<p>"In the convention of 1846, which formed the present
Constitution of the State of New York, Mr. Tilden, from the
select committee to whom was referred the report of the
standing committee on the subject of corporations, made the
following report:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'Section 1. Corporations may be formed under general
laws, but shall not be created by special act, except for
municipal purposes, and in cases where, in the judgment of
the Legislature, the objects of the corporation cannot be attained
under general laws. All general laws and special
acts passed pursuant to this section may be altered from
time to time or repealed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"'Section 3. The term corporations as used in this article
shall be construed to include all associations and joint stock
companies having any of the powers of corporations not
possessed by individuals or partnerships.'</p></blockquote>

<p>"At the afternoon session on the same day the first section
was adopted unanimously, and the above clause of the third
section was adopted without considerable opposition.</p>

<p>"The discussion in the convention shows that those clauses
were understood to apply to all corporations then existing
or thereafter to be created.</p>

<p>"Those provisions stand in the Constitution of the State
of New York. They are referred to in a speech on canals
and railroads made by Mr. Tilden in the constitutional convention
of 1867. The passage is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'The convention of 1846, by provisions which it fell to
my lot to report, provided, first, in favor of a system of incorporation
under general laws, and, secondly, for a supervisory
legislative control over the chartered power and privileges
of all corporate bodies.</p>

<p>"'In my judgment, those two provisions were, and are,
perfectly adequate to secure every public object, however
freely we may grant to private enterprise all the powers
necessary to enable it to create these great machines of travel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_710" id="Page_710">[710]</a></span>
and transportation, and to the management of them by corporate
bodies, which can serve the public with more skill
and economy than the State can. The authority thus reserved
to the State is doubtless capable of being perverted
by it to private injury and oppression; but it seemed to be
necessary to the public safety, and is a trust to be exercised
with wisdom and justice.'</p></blockquote>

<p>"The general Railroad act, chapter 140 of the Statute
Laws of 1850, passed April 2 of that year, faithfully executed
the mandate of the Constitution. The forty-eighth
section of that act is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'The Legislature may at any time annul or dissolve any
incorporation formed under this act; but such dissolution
shall not take away or impair any remedy given against
any such corporation, its stockholders, or officers, for any
liability which shall have been previously incurred."</p></blockquote>

<p>"The Broadway Railroad charter was formed under chapter
252 of the laws of 1884, entitled 'An act to provide for
the construction, extension, maintenance, and operation of
street surface railroads and branches thereof in cities, towns,
and villages.'</p>

<p>"The first section of that act expressly provides that every
corporation formed under it 'shall also have all the powers
and privileges granted, and be subject to all the liabilities
imposed by this act, or by the act entitled "An act to authorize
the formation of railroad corporations, and to regulate
the same," passed April 2, 1850, and the several acts
amendatory thereof, except as the said acts are herein
modified.'</p>

<p>"In the case of 'The People of the State of New York
against Dispensary and Hospital Society of the Women's
Institute of the city of New York' (7 Lansing, page 304),
a corporation formed 'under an act of the Legislature of the
State of New York, entitled "An act for the incorporation
of benevolent, charitable, scientific, and missionary societies,
passed April 12, 1848, and the acts amendatory thereof,"'
was judicially determined to have forfeited its charter by
reason of the payment of money as a reward for the use of
influence in obtaining an appropriation from the State, and
the corporation was dissolved by judgment of the court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_711" id="Page_711">[711]</a></span></p>

<p>"The authority of the Legislature to repeal a charter is
much broader than the judicial authority. It is expressly
declared by the Constitution and by the law to be in the discretion
of the Legislature. It may be done on moral evidence
of wrong-doing on the part of the corporation, while
a court could only act on judicial proof. It may be done
on grounds of public policy or expediency.</p>

<p>"The bill pending in the Senate for repealing the charter
of the Broadway Company and annulling its franchise may
do well enough if a Broadway railroad is to exist.</p>

<p>"Whether any holders of Broadway Railroad stock or
bonds can be shown to be innocent and entitled to special indulgence,
can be better judged of when the investigations are
concluded.</p>

<p>"One thing is quite clear. The corruption of public
officers in order to obtain possession of valuable franchises at
much less than their real worth, can only be stopped by
making such schemes impossible to result in any profit.</p>

<p>"A general law should be passed requiring every such
franchise to be disposed of at public auction.</p>

<p>"If proofs cannot be found to bring the wrong-doers to
criminal punishment, the confiscation of their investment
will be a salutary warning to them and to the public generally."</p>

<h2>TILDEN TO PRESIDENT CLEVELAND</h2>

<p>
"<i>Confidential.</i></p>

<p class="sig">"<span class="smcap">Greystone, Yonkers, N. Y.</span>, <i>March 12, 1886</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. President</span>,&mdash;I read in the public journals
that the name of Brigadier-General Newton, Chief of Engineers
in the United States army, is before you for promotion
to a Major-Generalship.</p>

<p>"I have had occasion, in the course of his duties near the
city of New York, although having no personal acquaintance
with him, to form an opinion as to his character and capacities;
and have otherwise acquired information concerning
him.</p>

<p>"I believe him to be a very able and accomplished officer.
I understand that his commission as lieutenant antedates
that of all other officers now in active service; that he entered
West Point at the same time with General Pope, and
graduated higher in his class; that he graduated twelve years
prior to General Howard.</p>

<p>"Although a Virginian by birth, he greatly distinguished
himself on the Union side&mdash;commanding the First Army
Corps at Gettysburg, and taking an important part in other
battles.</p>

<p>"At his age, and to be retired more than six years sooner
than General Howard, unless he is now restored to the
priority to which he is entitled, he probably will be denied
altogether the promotion which his services, his character,
and capacity merit.</p>

<p>"Another consideration seems worthy of attention. The
highest honors of the army ought not to be confined exclusively
to Republicans, so long as Democrats not inferior,
not to say superior in services and professional capacity,
older soldiers if not better, remain to be chosen. General
Hancock's death made a vacancy which, though well filled,
was not filled by a successor of General Hancock's political
faith. General Newton's selection now would for the time
redress the balance.</p>

<p>"With assurances of cordial regard, I remain,</p>

permitting the resolution on coast defences to slumber too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_715" id="Page_715">[715]</a></span>

<p class="sig">
"Very truly yours,<br />
"<span class="smcap">S. J. Tilden</span>.</p>

<p>"I am here until Monday afternoon."
</p>


<h2>"SEA-COAST DEFENCES</h2>

<p>"In considering the state of the public revenues, the subject
involves the question whether we shall extinguish the
surplus by reducing the revenue; or, whether we shall apply
the surplus to payments on the public debt; or, whether we
shall seize the occasion to provide for our sea-coast defences,
which have been too long neglected. The Secretary is of the
opinion that the latter is a paramount necessity, which ought
to precede the reduction of the revenue; and ought, also, to
precede an excessive rapidity in the payment of the public
debt.</p>

<p>"The property exposed to destruction in the nine seaports&mdash;Portland,
Portsmouth, Boston, Newport, New York,
Philadelphia, Baltimore, New Orleans, and San Francisco&mdash;cannot
be less in value than five thousand millions of dollars.
To this must be added a vast amount of property dependent
for its use on three seaports. Nor does this statement afford
a true measure of the damage which might be carried to the
property and business of the country by a failure to protect
these seaports from hostile naval attacks.</p>

<p>"They are the centres, not only of foreign commerce, but
of most of the internal trade and exchanges of domestic
productions. To this state of things the machinery of transportation
of the whole country has become adapted.</p>

<p>"The interruptions of the currents of traffic by the occupation
of one of our principal seaports by a foreign enemy,
or the destruction of them by bombardment, or by the holding
over them the menace of destruction for the purpose of
exacting contribution or ransom, would inflict upon the
property and business of the country an injury which can
neither be foreseen nor measured.</p>

<p>"The elaborate and costly fortifications, which were constructed
with the greatest engineering skill, are now practically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_716" id="Page_716">[716]</a></span>
useless. They are not capable of resisting the attacks
of modern artillery.</p>

<p>"A still greater defect exists in our coast defences. The
range of the best modern artillery has become so extended
that our present fortifications, designed to protect the harbor
of New York, where two-thirds of the import trade and more
than one-half of the export trade of the whole United States
is carried on, are too near to the great populations of New
York city, Jersey City, and Brooklyn to be of any value as a
protection.</p>

<p>"To provide effectual defences would be the work of
years. It would take much time to construct permanent
fortifications. A small provision of the best modern guns
would take several years. Neither of these works can be
extemporized in presence of emergent danger. A million of
soldiers with the best equipments on the heights surrounding
the harbor of New York, in our present state of preparation,
or, rather, in our total want of preparation, would be powerless
to resist a small squadron of war-steamers.</p>

<p>"This state of things is discreditable to our foresight and
to our prudence.</p>

<p>"The best guarantee against aggression&mdash;the best assurance
that our diplomacy will be successful and pacific, and
that our rights and honor will be respected by other nations,
is in their knowledge that we are in a situation to vindicate
our reputation and interests. While we may afford to be
deficient in the means of defence, we cannot afford to be
defenceless. The notoriety of the fact that we have neglected
the ordinary precautions of defence invites want of consideration
in our diplomacy, injustice, arrogance, and insult
at the hands of foreign nations.</p>

<p>"It is now more than sixty years since we announced to
the world that we should resist any attempts, from whatever
quarter they might come, to make any new colonizations on
any part of the American continent&mdash;that while we should
respect the <em>status quo</em>, we should protect the people of the
different nations inhabiting this continent from every attempt
to subject them to the dominion of any European
power, or to interfere with their undisturbed exercise of the
rights of self-government.</p>

<p>"This announcement was formally made by President
Monroe, after consultation with Mr. Madison and Mr. Jefferson.
It was formulated by John Quincy Adams. Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_717" id="Page_717">[717]</a></span>
government has firmly adhered to the Monroe Doctrine, and
even so late as 1865 it warned Napoleon III. out of Mexico.</p>

<p>"It is impossible to foresee, in the recent scramble of the
European powers for the acquisition of colonies, how soon
an occasion may arise for our putting in practice the Monroe
Doctrine. It is clear that there ought to be some relation between
our assertion of this doctrine, and our preparation to
maintain it.</p>

<p>"It is not intended to recommend any attempt to rival the
great European powers in the creation of a powerful navy.
The changes which have rapidly occurred by the diminution
of the relative resisting power of the defensive armor of ironclads,
and by the increased efficiency of modern artillery&mdash;which,
on the whole, has gained in the competition&mdash;suggest
that we should not, at present, enter largely into the creation
of armored vessels.</p>

<p>"In the questions that beset this subject until they shall
have reached a solution, we can content ourselves with adding
but sparingly to our navy. But what we can add should
be the very best that experience and science can indicate.
This prudential view is reinforced by the consideration that
the annual charge of maintaining a war-vessel bears an important
proportion to the original cost of construction.</p>

<p>"In constructing permanent fortifications, and in providing
an ample supply of the best modern artillery, the
annual cost of maintenance is inconsiderable. Nearly the
whole expenditure is in the original outlay for construction.</p>

<p>"If we do not make this expenditure necessary to provide
for our sea-coast defences when we have a surplus, and have
no need to levy taxes, we certainly will not make those expenditures
when we have no longer a surplus in the Treasury.</p>

<p>"To leave our vast interests defenceless, in order to reduce
the cost of whiskey to its consumers, would be a solecism.</p>

<p>"The present time is peculiarly favorable for providing
for this great national necessity too long neglected. Not
only does the surplus in the Treasury supply ample means
to enable us to meet this great public want, without laying
new burdens upon the people, but the work can now be done
at a much lower cost than has ever before been possible.
The defensive works would consist almost entirely of steel
and iron. Those materials can now be had at an unprecedentedly
low price. A vast supply of machinery, and of labor,
called into existence by a great vicissitude in the steel and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_718" id="Page_718">[718]</a></span>
iron industries, offers itself to our service. We should have
the satisfaction of knowing that while we were availing ourselves
of these supplies, which would ordinarily be unattainable,
we were setting in motion important industries, and
giving employment to labor in a period of depression. With
encouragement by the guarantee of work, or, perhaps, by
the government itself furnishing the plant, the inventive
genius of our people would be applied to the creation of new
means and improved machinery, and establishments would
spring into existence capable of supplying all of the national
wants, and rendering us completely independent of all other
countries in respect to the means of national defence."</p>

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Jordan</span>,&mdash;You need have no hesitation in
suggesting to me anything in my power which you think
would be beneficial to Mr. Manning.</p>

<p>"The <i>Viking</i> is laid up for the winter, and has to undergo
some refitting before she can be brought into service.</p>

<p>"But I do not think Mr. Manning could, by any possibility,
use her with advantage, unless his present situation
should be greatly changed.</p>

<p>"It is too late in the season to go South. I do not believe
that Mr. Manning could bear the motion of the largest
ocean steamer, still less the greater motion of a small steamer,
or the gas and noise of the machinery. A great deal of
strength and health is required by the roughing incident to a
sea voyage of any considerable duration. I have myself to
limit my excursions in the <i>Viking</i> to a few hours at a time.
Nor would it be easy to take on board a man weighing 280
pounds who cannot walk, and more difficult still to convey
him down the narrow gangway.</p>

<p>"The medical treatment, as I understand, prescribes absolute
quiet; this is incompatible with yachting. I am here
for a few days, and shall then return to Greystone. I receive
frequent information in regard to Mr. Manning, but
should be glad of anything which you may be able to communicate.</p>

him best, as the place where he would be most secluded.
How he is to be replaced I can't see; there isn't a member
of the cabinet who has made the impression he has, either
on Congress or the people with whom he has been brought
in contact. 'The only Democrat' in the cabinet is the name
he goes by, and it called forth, when his sickness became
known, both from Democrats and Republicans, a general
expression of regret. He is said to be better to-day. I hope
so, but am afraid.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Tilden</span>,&mdash;It is so long since I have had the
pleasure of seeing you that I fear you may have forgotten
me, unless the newspapers have kept you advised of the
struggle I am now making to rescue my old company, the
Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company, from the receivership
and syndicate that now environ it.</p>

<p>"In this attempt I should, above all things, be delighted
to have your aid and counsel, and if you would give me a
half-hour of your time whenever and wherever most convenient
to yourself, it would give me very great pleasure to
bring to your attention, and ask your aid in favor of, the
scheme I have now prepared for the relief of the company.</p>

<h2>TILDEN TO GOVERNOR HILL</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Greystone, Yonkers, N. Y.</span>, <i>April 23, 1886</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Governor Hill</span>,&mdash;In submitting suggestions to
you, I should have great delicacy if I did not offer them as
mere suggestions which you, who have the public responsibility,
must pass upon according to your own judgment, and
not according to mine.</p>

<p>"In addition to the objections to the Consent bill, which
I mentioned in my letter of night before last, there is another
difficulty. That act does not provide any mode by
which railroads not now connecting with the Broadway Railroad
at Fourteenth Street can make such connections. This
would give great advantage to the Seventh Avenue Railroad
in competing at auction for the Broadway franchise.
If in consequence that company should succeed in getting
the franchise at a low price, such a result would be likely to
create a reaction against the reform movement.</p>

<p>"I adhere to the opinion that the Repeal bill and the
Winding-up bill should be acted upon promptly; that the
Consent bill should be retained for fuller consideration and,
eventually, be rejected.</p>

<p>"About the remaining bill of the four reported by the
Senate Investigating Committee, I cannot find, by the newspapers,
that it has passed.</p>

<p>"It seems to me better than the original Cantor bill, which
is now a law, but it still has serious defects.</p>

<p>"1. It leaves the present law standing whereby the general
term, appointing commissioners, and rectifying their
action, will dispense with the consent of the abutting property-holders.</p>

<p>"2. It allows the Aldermen to pass over the veto of the
Mayor a resolution granting a railroad franchise, provided
the consent of one-half of the abutting property-owners be
obtained.</p>

<p>"The first defect is the most serious. Perhaps the second
may be risked, though I do not think it quite safe to dispense
with any restrictions upon these grants.</p>

<p>"I do not know whether it is intended to pass this bill, or
whether it can be amended.</p>

<p>"In discussing these bills, I am not advised how far, if
at all, any of them have been changed by amendment.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Governor</span>,&mdash;Agreeable to my promise, I write
you regarding the present condition of the Secretary. He is
recovering quite rapidly. He takes an interest in the affairs
of the department; makes inquiries regarding the same; has
interviews with various departmental officers. He seems to
have retained his full mental vigor. He is not able as yet
to walk freely, but it is expected that within a short time
he will regain sufficient strength to enable him to go out upon
the street without the aid of an attendant. It is proposed
that as soon as he is able to walk that he visit some of the
springs&mdash;White Sulphur Springs, if you please&mdash;and take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_723" id="Page_723">[723]</a></span>
a course of treatment, bathing, &amp;c., after which, it is thought,
that he will be able to take his vacation.</p>

<p>"In an interview I had with him, I stated what you had
said regarding the yachting cruise, and what you would be
pleased to do, &amp;c., &amp;c. He seemed very much delighted with
the idea; said he was very fond of yachting, and thought he
would enjoy it very much indeed. He said he had thought
of taking a little cruise inspecting the light-houses along the
Potomac, &amp;c. I did not state to him what you said to me regarding
the unhealthy condition of the Potomac, regarding
which I agree with you. I think it would be much better
for him if he could take the Hudson River and Sound, going
as far east as New Bedford and Martha's Vineyard.</p>

<h2>TILDEN TO MAYOR GRACE</h2>

"<span class="smcap">Greystone, Yonkers, N. Y.</span>, <i>May 7th, 1886</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mayor Grace</span>,&mdash;I have from the beginning taken
great interest in the welfare of the Central Park. I had
much to do in enlarging it from the northern limit, which
originally was a straight line across the hill and the ravine.</p>

<p>"This is my excuse for writing to you now. It is my
judgment, and the judgment of many of the original friends
of the Park, that the filling in of a portion of the ravine is
a great wrong. It is probably the beginning of a series of
measures which will be the desecration and ruin of the natural
beauties of the great pleasure-ground of the people.
It matters not whether these results come from incompetency
or from jobbery. A change in the administration of the
Park seems to be absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen well acquainted with the subject, and with
the individual, recommend the appointment of Mr. C. H.
Woodman in the vacancy which you are about to fill.</p>

<p>"I am satisfied of his competency and integrity; and join
my entreaty with those of the public, that you will rescue
that imperilled work by his selection. After the mischief
is done to the Park, and the people realize it, there will be
a storm of indignation. All this can be averted by you now.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Governor</span>,&mdash;I send you herewith a printed slip
of correspondence that has recently occurred between two of
your acquaintances. You will learn from it that I want to
leave Washington and go home, and that the President is
loath to have me go. He prefers to give me leave of absence,
and at the outset named the 1st of August as the limit. To
this I demurred, because the 1st of August marks the middle
of every sensible person's vacation, and brings to us extreme
hot weather. I could not bring myself to think it would
be right for me to return here at that early day, and in the
mean time my mind would be worried by thoughts of returning
to the old tread-mill, in the hottest part of Washington's
hot season. So the President changed it to the 1st of Oct.,
which certainly is a more proper date.</p>

<p>"I trust that what I have done, or rather what I have let
be done, will have your approval.</p>

<p>"We are making arrangements for me to go to the Hot
Springs of West Virginia within the next two or three days.
I think we shall remain there about a month. After that,
I hope I may be permitted by my physician to go North,
in which event I want to visit you at Greystone, if only for
an hour. That, I know, will do me great good.</p>

ought to be rejected.</p>

<p>"1. The bill pretending to abolish imprisonment for debt.
Your inquiry as to its effect upon Tweed's case, if this bill

the important points.</p>

<p>"If there are cases where the present law ought to be
ameliorated, they should be specified. The present bill is
not fit to be passed.</p>

<p>"If you will compare the bill with the existing law, you
will see that the bill is deceptive and fraudulent.</p>

<p>"2. The bill appropriating $200,000 towards doubling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_725" id="Page_725">[725]</a></span>

<p>"I will thank you to send me a printed copy of this document.</p>

<p>"The apathy of Congress on this subject would be incredible,

<p>"It contrasts with the rivalry which is so conspicuous to
insist on our taking a high tone towards foreign nations on
every occasion of difference between them and us.</p>

<p>"It contrasts, also, with the favor which is shown to
schemes of prodigality, and schemes to waste the public resources
on things known to be absolutely useless.</p>

<p>"Among the people, the desire for liberal appropriations
towards the means of public defence, is well-nigh unanimous.</p>

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Mr. D. D. Field has succeeded in getting
through the Legislature a bill purporting to be a codification
of the Law of Evidence.</p>

<p>"It is as bad as, or worse than, any of his schemes for
bedevilling the law under the pretence of simplifying it.</p>

<p>"No one man in twenty of the members even read it, as
I am assured. It is replete with gross errors, and in many
ways changes the existing law not only in respect to evidence,
but other topics.</p>

<p>"The chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the Assembly,
who was mainly instrumental in working it through
both houses, confessed before the Governor last Thursday
in my presence that in its present shape it is unfit to go into
operation.</p>

<p>"He urges the executive approval on the ground that it
contains a clause authorizing the Governor to appoint a
commission for the purpose of amending it, and postponing
the time of its taking effect until after the next session.</p>

<p>"This very provision seems to me to be abundantly sufficient
to call for a veto. There can be no more shocking
fallacy than that it is safe to pass bad laws merely because
they may be amended.</p>

<p>"I write this to the end that, should the Governor consult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_727" id="Page_727">[727]</a></span>
you about this measure, you may have such assurance as my
opinion, whatever that may amount to, may afford that it is
an unwise one.</p>

brought about measureless mischief, and I am doing
all I can to prevent the further progress of it.</p>

stimulating effect of the baths are health-restoring, and I

to my strength that I have gathered.</p>

<p>"I suffer somewhat from an old complaint characteristic

myself to start for New York early in July. There are several
subjects about which I am anxious to consult you, and

<p>"Like Dr. Simmons, Dr. Hun does not think there is any
serious difficulty of the heart, but because of shortness of
breath advises caution. I feel that I would like to go to the
Catskill Mountains, but because Dr. Hun shows preference
for the sea air, I have communicated with the Watch Hill
House landlord, and hear that he will give me desirable
quarters on the 29th of this month. I think we shall go
there. No doubt I can get there all the exercise that I may
need.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Manning had the pleasure of meeting, at the railroad
station yesterday, Miss Ruby <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> to Lebanon, and

<p>"A letter from Fairchild tells me that the N. Y. collector

I be given the use of the revenue-cutter <i>Grant</i>. You will
conclude, of course, that this means much. I replied that if
I concluded I should like to use that boat, I would communicate
thereon with the President and himself. It is better
so, but I have determined to give up the idea. I cannot
place myself under such obligations. Nothing of the kind
has been suggested or offered to me.</p>

<p>"The President and two or three of his secretaries are to

Thompson about the Custom-house. He says the President

<h2>BIGELOW TO WHITTIER</h2>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">21 Gramercy Park, New York</span>, <i>Aug. 14, 1886</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Venerable and dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am impatient to thank
you for your admirably just and graceful tribute to the memory
of my friend, the late Mr. Tilden.</p>

<p>"Though a prince of peace by training and self-discipline,
Mr. Tilden, like all men of large moral proportions, came
not to bring peace into the world, but the sword, and like
all such men was much misunderstood and misrepresented;
in many cases by those who at heart were entirely in sympathy
with his aims. Of these latter, I venture to think you
have made yourself the faithful and acceptable interpreter.
You are right in thinking Mr. Tilden was ambitious, but
his was not the kind of ambition by which angels fell. He
sought power as a means, not as an end. To the mere pomp
and circumstance of official eminence, no man could be more
indifferent. His ideal of a State was a very exalted one,
and he thought, in 1876, that he needed the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pou sto</i> of the
Presidency to realize it. A majority of his countrymen were
apparently of the same opinion. It was ordained, however,
that he should never attain that eminence, as it was ordained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_732" id="Page_732">[732]</a></span>
that Moses should never enter into the Promised Land. If
he ever murmured at his fate, it was as a citizen, and not
as a candidate; as a victim of a wrong to the Republic, not
to himself. He accumulated a large fortune in the prosecution
of an honorable profession; but in his professional, as
in his political, career, he was always accomplishing more for
others than for himself. The acquisition of his own fortune
was but incidental to the enrichment of a multitude.</p>

<p>"Had he been 'perfect,' he would, of course, have 'sold
what he had, and given it to the poor.' He was not perfect.
But few, however, have come much nearer to this divine
standard than Mr. Tilden has done, in consecrating the
greater part of the fruits of a laborious life to the welfare of
his fellow creatures.</p>

<p>"Your verses encourage me to hope that death has lifted
the veil which concealed from the world many of my friend's
virtues, and much of his greatness.</p>

<p class="sig">
"Respectfully and gratefully yours,<br />
"<span class="smcap">John Bigelow</span>."

Louisiana vote were necessary, one of which had to be forwarded to
the president of the Senate by mail, another delivered to him by hand,
and the third deposited with the United States district judge&mdash;all of
which had to be accomplished within a certain number of days. When
the Republican messenger&mdash;one T. C. Anderson&mdash;arrived in Washington
and delivered the package containing one of those three certificates
to Mr. Ferry, the president of the Senate, that gentleman
called his attention to an irregularity in the form of the endorsement
on the envelope and suggested that he consider its legal effect. Anderson
therefore retained the package, and secretly opened it to ascertain
if the error had been repeated in the certificate itself. To his consternation
he discovered far more vital defects in the document, and
flying back to New Orleans consulted with the party leaders, who
agreed that the instrument must be redrawn, and the electors were
hastily resumed. Then, to the managers' horror, it was discovered
that two of the necessary officials were absent, and could not possibly
be reached within the time limited by law for the delivery of the
paper in Washington. 'Heroic' measures were therefore deemed essential,
and after all the available signatures had been obtained the
others were forged, and the doctored certificates, which, of course,
were obviously different from the one previously forwarded by mail,
were rushed back to Washington just in the nick of time. All these
facts were subsequently unearthed, but those who actually committed
the forgeries were never detected."&mdash;H. R. R., No. 140, 45th Cong.,

testified to-day to an interview with Governor Wells, in which the
latter said that he thought he had done wrong in throwing out 1,100
votes in New Orleans and 1,400 votes in the Parish of East Baton
Rouge. He also asked what guarantee Kennedy supposed would be
given him if he so arranged the returns as to protect him and secure
him his property and standing among the people of the State of
Louisiana.</p></div>

Mr. Hayes instead of the candidate chosen by the people into the
Presidency is more clearly set forth in a communication of the writer
entitled, "The Supreme Court and the Electoral Commission: An Open
Letter to the Hon. Joseph H. Choate," first published in the New York
<cite>Sun</cite>, on the 19th July, 1903, and later in a pamphlet by G. P. Putnam's

In June of 1877 Mr. James G. Blaine was one of the Inspectors of the
United States Military Academy at West Point. He spent an afternoon
with me at my residence in the immediate neighborhood, and the
action of the Electoral Tribunal, among other things, became naturally
enough a topic of conversation. He said, with some emphasis, "I was
surprised at the time that the Democrats consented to the Electoral
Tribunal," and added in substance&mdash;I cannot pretend to recall his
exact words&mdash;that if they had remained firm it could not have succeeded.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_33_33" id="Footnote_33_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_33"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> While knowing nothing of this correspondence, Mr. Tilden asked
me one day while it proves to have been going on, "how the office
of Secretary of Treasury would suit me, or rather how I would like
it." I replied very promptly that I would not like it at all, nor
would I accept it under any imaginable conditions; that I was principled
against accepting any station, private or public, that I did not
believe I could fill creditably, and that I did not feel competent to
fill that office creditably; nor would I take it if I did, for its duties
would be, from the beginning to the end, absolutely uncongenial to me.</p></div>

to the country.</p></div>
